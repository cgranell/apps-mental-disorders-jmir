Article,A Guided Online and Mobile Self-Help Program for Individuals With Eating Disorders: An Iterative Engagement and Usability Study,"BACKGROUND: Numerous digital health interventions have been developed for mental health promotion and intervention, including eating disorders. Efficacy of many interventions has been evaluated, yet knowledge about reasons for dropout and poor adherence is scarce. Most digital health intervention studies lack appropriate research design and methods to investigate individual engagement issues. User engagement and program usability are inextricably linked, making usability studies vital in understanding and improving engagement. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore engagement and corresponding usability issues of the Healthy Body Image Program-a guided online intervention for individuals with body image concerns or eating disorders. The secondary aim was to demonstrate the value of usability research in order to investigate engagement. METHODS: We conducted an iterative usability study based on a mixed-methods approach, combining cognitive and semistructured interviews as well as questionnaires, prior to program launch. Two separate rounds of usability studies were completed, testing a total of 9 potential users. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the think-aloud tasks, interviews, and questionnaires. RESULTS: Participants were satisfied with the overall usability of the program. The average usability score was 77.5/100 for the first test round and improved to 83.1/100 after applying modifications for the second iteration. The analysis of the qualitative data revealed five central themes: layout, navigation, content, support, and engagement conditions. The first three themes highlight usability aspects of the program, while the latter two highlight engagement issues. An easy-to-use format, clear wording, the nature of guidance, and opportunity for interactivity were important issues related to usability. The coach support, time investment, and severity of users' symptoms, the program's features and effectiveness, trust, anonymity, and affordability were relevant to engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified salient usability and engagement features associated with participant motivation to use the Healthy Body Image Program and ultimately helped improve the program prior to its implementation. This research demonstrates that improvements in usability and engagement can be achieved by testing and adjusting intervention design and content prior to program launch. The results are consistent with related research and reinforce the need for further research to identify usage patterns and effective means for reducing dropout. Digital health research should include usability studies prior to efficacy trials to help create more user-friendly programs that have a higher likelihood of {""}real-world{""} adoption.",Journal of medical Internet research,M.

Article,A pilot study of the acceptability and usability of a smartphone application intervention for suicidal adolescents and their parents.,"Interconnectedness through technology presents both challenges and opportunities for suicide prevention and intervention with adolescents and families. The time following discharge from acute care facilities represents a critical period of suicide risk for adolescents, which could be buffered by a technological intervention they could use post-discharge. Crisis Care is a smartphone application intervention developed specifically for suicidal adolescents and their parents to use during this period of increased risk. A web-based prototype of Crisis Care was pilot tested with 20 adolescent-parent dyads. Results demonstrated acceptability and usability, suggesting the utility of technological interventions, such as Crisis Care, as an adjunct to treatment for suicidal adolescents and their parents following discharge from acute care settings.

Article,A Pilot Study to Examine the Feasibility and Potential Effectiveness of Using Smartphones to Provide Recovery Support for Adolescents,"Smartphone applications can potentially provide recovery monitoring and support in real-time, real-life contexts. Study aims included determining feasibility of (a) adolescents completing ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and utilizing phone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs); and (b) using EMA and EMI data to predict substance use in the subsequent week. Methods: Twenty-nine adolescents were recruited at discharge from residential treatment, regardless of their discharge status or length of stay. During the 6-week pilot, youth were prompted to complete an EMA at 6 random times per day and were provided access to a suite of recovery support EMI. Youth completed 87\% of the 5580 EMAs. Based on use in the next 7 days, EMA observations were classified into 3 risk groups: {""}Current Use{""} in the past 30 minutes (3\% of observations), {""}Unrecognized Risk{""} (42\%), or {""}Recognized Risk{""} (55\%). All youth had observations in 2 or more risk groups and 38\% in all 3. Youth accessed an EMI on average 162 times each week. Results: Participants were 31\% female, 48\% African American, 21\% Caucasian, 7\% Hispanic, and 24\% Mixed/Other; average age was 16.6 years. During the 90 days prior to entering treatment, youth reported using alcohol (38\%), marijuana (41\%), and other drugs (7\%). When compared with the {""}Recognized Risk{""} group's use in the following week (31\%), both the {""}Unrecognized Risk{""} (50\%, odds ratio [OR] = 2.08) and {""}Current Use{""} (96\%, OR = 50.30) groups reported significantly higher rates of use in the next week. When an EMI was accessed 2 or more times within the hour following an EMA, the rate of using during the next week was significantly lower than when EMIs were not accessed (32\% vs. 43\%, OR = 0.62). Conclusions: Results demonstrate the feasibility of using smartphones for recovery monitoring and support with adolescents, with potential to reduce use. 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Substance Abuse,M.L.

Article,A randomized controlled study of exposure therapy as aftercare for alcohol use disorder: Study protocol,"Background: It is well documented that individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) respond well during evidence-based psychological treatment, but also that a large proportion relapses when discharged from treatment and confronted with alcohol in real life. Cue Exposure Treatment (CET) focuses on exposing individuals to alcohol cues in order to reduce cravings as well as the likelihood of relapse. The aims of the study are: 1) to investigate whether CET aftercare delivered via a smartphone or in group sessions increases the effect of Cognitive Behavioural Treatment in groups of alcohol dependent individuals; 2) to investigate whether CET as a smartphone application is as or more effective than CET group therapy, and 3) to investigate whether CET as a smartphone application is more cost-effective than CET group aftercare and Aftercare as Usual. Design and methods: The study will be implemented as an investigator-blinded randomized controlled trial. A total of 300 consecutively enrolled alcohol use disorder individuals recruited from an alcohol outpatient clinic will be randomized into one of the three following aftercare groups after concluding primary treatment: (1) CET as a smartphone application; (2) CET as group therapy, and (3) Aftercare as Usual. It is hypothesized that the two experimental groups will achieve better treatment outcomes compared to the control group (3). Discussion: Individuals in the CET groups are given the opportunity to practise coping strategies during exposure to alcohol stimuli before being unavoidably confronted with alcohol and associated stimuli in real life. Thus, CET may help prevent patients from relapsing after concluding treatment, and in the long term. Moreover, the CET application has the potential to improve AUD treatment and continuing care by offering psychological treatment whenever and wherever the patient finds it convenient.

Article,A randomized controlled trial of a smartphone app for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms,"Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in the population, but relatively few affected individuals receive treatment for it. Smartphone applications (apps) could help address this unmet need by offering sound psychoeducational information and evidence-based cognitive behavioral coping tools. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a free, publicly available smartphone app (PTSD Coach) for self-management of PTSD symptoms. Method: One hundred 20 participants who were an average of 39 years old, mostly women (69.2\%) and White (66.7\%), recruited primarily through online advertisements, were randomized to either a PTSD Coach (n = 62) or a waitlist condition (n = 58) for 3 months. Web-administered self-report measures of PTSD, PTSD symptom coping self-efficacy, depression, and psychosocial functioning were conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months following treatment. Results: Following the intent-to-treat principle, repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that at posttreatment, PTSD Coach participants had significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptoms (p =.035), depression symptoms (p =.005), and psychosocial functioning (p =.007) than did waitlist participants; however, at posttreatment, there were no significant mean differences in outcomes between conditions. A greater proportion of PTSD Coach participants achieved clinically significant PTSD symptom improvement (p =.018) than waitlist participants. Conclusion: PTSD Coach use resulted in significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptoms and other outcomes relative to a waitlist condition. Given the ubiquity of smartphones, PTSD Coach may provide a wide-reaching, convenient public health intervention for individuals with PTSD symptoms who are not receiving care. 2017 American Psychological Association.",Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,E.

Article,A Scenario-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Mobile App to Reduce Dysfunctional Beliefs in Individuals with Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: While self-administered mobile app-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown efficiency and effectiveness over the past decade, attempts to address automatic and negative beliefs have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation.; RESULTS: After completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores.; CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and efficacious cognitive therapy.

Article,A Smarter Pathway for Delivering Cue Exposure Therapy? The Design and Development of a Smartphone App Targeting Alcohol Use Disorder,"Background: Although the number of alcohol-related treatments in app stores is proliferating, none of them are based on a psychological framework and supported by empirical evidence. Cue exposure treatment (CET) with urge-specific coping skills (USCS) is often used in Danish treatment settings. It is an evidence-based psychological approach that focuses on promoting â€œconfrontation with alcohol cuesâ€ as a means of reducing urges and the likelihood of relapse. Objective: The objective of this study was to describe the design and development of a CET-based smartphone app; an innovative delivery pathway for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). Methods: The treatment is based on Monty and coworkers' manual for CET with USCS (2002). It was created by a multidisciplinary team of psychiatrists, psychologists, programmers, and graphic designers as well as patients with AUD. A database was developed for the purpose of registering and monitoring training activities. A final version of the CET app and database was developed after several user tests. Results: The final version of the CET app includes an introduction, 4 sessions featuring USCS, 8 alcohol exposure videos promoting the use of one of the USCS, and a results component providing an overview of training activities and potential progress. Real-time urges are measured before, during, and after exposure to alcohol cues and are registered in the app together with other training activity variables. Data packages are continuously sent in encrypted form to an external database and will be merged with other data (in an internal database) in the future. Conclusions: The CET smartphone app is currently being tested at a large-scale, randomized controlled trial with the aim of clarifying whether it can be classified as an evidence-based treatment solution. The app has the potential to augment the reach of psychological treatment for AUD.",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,Angelina Isabella Mellentin and Elsebeth Stenager and Bent Nielsen and Anette Sogaard Nielsen and Fei Yu,2017,"mobile application, smartphone, exposure therapy, alcohol use disorder",021 - A Smarter Pathway for Delivering Cue,021,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,NOT KNOWN,YES,NOT KNOWN,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,NOT KNOWN,NO,NOT KNOWN,NO,NO,YES,NO,NOT KNOWN,NOT KNOWN,NOT KNOWN,NOT KNOWN,NOT KNOWN,NOT KNOWN,CET Application,Denmark,16-Substance-related and addictive disorders,16,Substance-related and addictive disorders,NA,Alcohol use disorder,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,QUALITATIVE STUDY,NA,2,2 patient focus groups (2xn=5),Intervention condition (experimental); There is not any control group.,NO,NO ASSESSMENT,NO,Denmark
Article,A Smartphone App (BlueIce) for Young People Who Self-Harm: Open Phase 1 Pre-Post Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen a significant increase in the availability of smartphone apps for mental health problems. Despite their proliferation, few apps have been specifically developed for young people, and almost none have been subject to any form of evaluation.; OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to undertake a preliminary evaluation of a smartphone app (BlueIce), coproduced with young people and designed to help young people manage distress and urges to self-harm. We aimed to assess the acceptability, safety, and use of BlueIce and to explore the effects on the primary outcome of self-harm and the secondary outcomes of psychological functioning.; METHODS: We undertook an open trial where we recruited young people aged 12 to 17 years attending specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) who were currently self-harming or had a history of self-harm. Eligible participants were assessed at baseline and then given BlueIce. They were assessed 2 weeks later (post familiarization) and again at 12 weeks (post use). A behavior-screening questionnaire (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) was completed along with standardized measures of depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire or MFQ) and anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale or RCADS), taking into account self-reports of self-harm, app helpfulness, and safety.; RESULTS: All core CAMHS professional groups referred at least 1 young person. Out of 40 young people recruited, 37 (93\%) elected to use BlueIce after familiarization, with 29 out of 33 (88\%) wanting to keep it at the end of the study. No young person called the emergency numbers during the 12-week trial, and no one was withdrawn by his or her clinician due to increased risk of suicide. Almost three-quarters (73\%) of those who had recently self-harmed reported reductions in self-harm after using BlueIce for 12 weeks. There was a statistically significant mean difference of 4.91 (t31=2.11; P=.04; 95\% CI 0.17-9.64) on postuse symptoms of depression (MFQ) and 13.53 on symptoms of anxiety (RCADS) (t30=3.76; P=.001; 95\% CI 6.17-20.90), which was evident across all anxiety subscales. Ratings of app acceptability and usefulness were high.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study has a number of methodological limitations, particularly the absence of a comparison group and a prospective way of assessing self-harm. Nonetheless, our findings are encouraging and suggest that BlueIce, used alongside a traditional CAMHS face-to-face intervention, can help young people manage their emotional distress and urges to self-harm.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,Paul Stallard and Joanna Porter and Rebecca Grist,2018,"cognitive behavioral therapy, mHealth, smartphone, adolescents, mobile apps, BlueIce, self-injury",022 - A Smartphone App (BlueIce) for Young People,022,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NA,NOT KNOWN,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,Blue Ice,United Kingdom,25-Suicidal behavior disorder/nonsuicidal self-injury,25,Suicidal behavior disorder/nonsuicidal self-injury,NA,Self-harm,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,OPEN UNCONTROLLED TRIAL,"Almost three-quarters (73%) of those who had recently self-harmed reported reductions in self-harm after using BlueIce

Apart of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy, self-management of negative emotions is of paramount importance, because relapse of depression often results from an inadequate response to negative emotions. The purpose of this study is to design and implement a personal recommender system, for emotion regulation. It assists users to be aware of negative emotions and guides them to deal with it with behavioral activation. It analyzes the smartphone usage patterns to predict the emergence of negative emotions, while integrating data obtained from context awareness and psychiatrists' recommendations to suggest relevant emotion-regulating activities.

Article,A study protocol for a non-randomised comparison trial evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of a mobile cognitive-behavioural programme with integrated coaching for anxious adults in primary care.,"INTRODUCTION: Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and subclinical GAD are highly prevalent in primary care. Unmanaged anxiety worsens quality of life in patients seen in primary care practices and leads to increased medical utilisation and costs. Programmes that teach patients cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques have been shown to improve anxiety and to prevent the evolution of anxiety symptoms to disorders, but access and engagement have hampered integration of CBT into medical settings.; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pragmatic study takes place in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center primary care practices to evaluate a coach-supported mobile cognitive- behavioural programme (Lantern) on anxiety symptoms and quality of life. Clinics were non-randomly assigned to either enhanced treatment as usual or Lantern. All clinics provide electronic screening for anxiety and, within clinics assigned to Lantern, patients meeting a threshold level of mild anxiety (ie, {\textbackslash}textgreater5 on Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Questionnaire (GAD-7)) are referred to Lantern. The first study phase is aimed at establishing feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness. The second phase focuses on long-term impact on psychosocial outcomes, healthcare utilisation and clinic/provider adoption/sustainable implementation using a propensity score matched parallel group study design. Primary outcomes are changes in anxiety symptoms (GAD-7) and quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey) between baseline and 6-month follow-ups, comparing control and intervention. Secondary outcomes include provider and patient satisfaction, patient engagement, durability of changes in anxiety symptoms and quality of life over 12 months and the impact of Lantern on healthcare utilisation over 12 months. Patients from control sites will be matched to the patients who use the mobile app.; ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics and human subject research approval were obtained. A data safety monitoring board is overseeing trial data and ethics. Results will be communicated to participating primary care practices, published and presented at clinical and scientific conferences.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03035019.

Article,A Virtual Hope Box: Randomized controlled trial of a smartphone app for emotional regulation and coping with distress,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app to improve stress coping skills, suicidal ideation, and perceived reasons for living among patients at elevated risk of suicide and self-harm. Methods: The authors conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two groups of U.S. service veterans in active mental health treatment who had recently expressed suicidal ideation. Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12-week period. Three measures-the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory-were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures-the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Results: VHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=.29-4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95\% CI=.08-5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB. Conclusions: The VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment-an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care. 2017 American Psychiatric Association.

InProceedings,A wearable and mobile intervention delivery system for individuals with panic disorder,"Panic disorder is a serious condition that affects approximately six million adults in the United States per year. Reducing the severity of panic attack symptoms would allow a better quality of life for panic attack sufferers. This paper presents steps towards a mobile and wearable system that aims to help reduce the severity of symptoms experienced by individuals with this condition. The system provides a way to continuously monitor the physiological data of an individual via a wearable device. Users are able to report when panic attacks take place, along with a rating of the severity of symptoms experienced. Reported episodes provide ground truth data to build panic prediction models. The eventual goal of the system is to make predictions about approaching panic attacks and to deliver interventions that help the individual to cope with the approaching episode. We describe a mobile-based intervention that has been developed, which instructs the individual to perform breathing and relaxation exercises. Presently, the system has been utilized in a small pilot study where 10 individuals who suffer from panic disorder reported 29 panic attacks while collecting physiological data, along with the severity of symptoms. We found that out of 15 symptoms the ones with high severity reported were anxiety, worry and shortness of breath. Furthermore, physiological differences were observed between panic and non-panic intervals. 2015 ACM.",NA,L. Cruz and J. Rubin and R. Abreu and S. Ahern and H. Eldardiry and D.G.

Article,Acceptability of Mental Health Apps for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians: A Qualitative Study,"Background: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians experience high rates of mental illness and psychological distress compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. E-mental health tools offer an opportunity for accessible, effective, and acceptable treatment. The AIMhi Stay Strong app and the ibobbly suicide prevention app are treatment tools designed to combat the disproportionately high levels of mental illness and stress experienced within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Objective: This study aimed to explore Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members' experiences of using two culturally responsive e-mental health apps and identify factors that influence the acceptability of these approaches. Methods: Using qualitative methods aligned with a phenomenological approach, we explored the acceptability of two culturally responsive e-mental health apps through a series of three 3-hour focus groups with nine Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members. Thematic analysis was conducted and coresearcher and member checking were used to verify findings. Results: Findings suggest strong support for the concept of e-mental health apps and optimism for their potential. Factors that influenced acceptability related to three key themes: personal factors (eg, motivation, severity and awareness of illness, technological competence, and literacy and language differences), environmental factors (eg, community awareness, stigma, and availability of support), and app characteristics (eg, ease of use, content, graphics, access, and security and information sharing). Specific adaptations, such as local production, culturally relevant content and graphics, a purposeful journey, clear navigation, meaningful language, options to assist people with language differences, offline use, and password protection may aid uptake.

Article,"Acceptability, Use, and Safety of a Mobile Phone App (BlueIce) for Young People Who Self-Harm: Qualitative Study of Service Users' Experience.","BACKGROUND: Self-harm is common among adolescents and is associated with a number of negative psychosocial outcomes including a higher risk of suicide. Recent reviews highlight the lack of research into specific interventions for children and young people who self-harm. Developing innovative interventions that are coproduced with individuals with lived experience and that reduce self-harm are key challenges for self-harm prevention.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the acceptability, use, and safety of BlueIce, a mobile phone app for young people who self-harm and who are attending child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).; METHODS: This study is part of a mixed methods phase 1 trial of BlueIce. Young people aged 12-17 years attending specialist CAMHS were recruited. Clinicians were invited to refer young people who were self-harming or who had a history of self-harm. On consent being obtained and baseline measures taken, participants used BlueIce as an adjunct to usual care for an initial familiarization period of 2 weeks. If after this time they wanted to continue, they used BlueIce for a further 10 weeks. Semistructured interviews were conducted at postfamiliarization (2 weeks after using BlueIce) and postuse (12 weeks after using BlueIce) to assess the acceptability, use, and safety of BlueIce. We undertook a qualitative analysis using a deductive approach, and then an inductive approach, to investigate common themes.; RESULTS: Postfamiliarization interviews were conducted with 40 participants. Of these, 37 participants elected to use BlueIce, with postuse interviews being conducted with 33 participants. Following 6 key themes emerged from the data: (1) appraisal of BlueIce, (2) usability of BlueIce, (3) safety, (4) benefits of BlueIce, (5) agency and control, and (6) BlueIce less helpful. The participants reported that BlueIce was accessible, easy to use, and convenient. Many highlighted the mood diary and mood lifter sections as particularly helpful in offering a way to track their moods and offering new strategies to manage their thoughts to self-harm. No adverse effects were reported. For those who did not find BlueIce helpful, issues around motivation to stop self-harming impeded their ability to use the app.; CONCLUSIONS: BlueIce was judged to be a helpful and safe way of supporting adolescents to manage thoughts of self-harming. Adolescents reported numerous benefits of using BlueIce, and all would recommend the app to other young people who were struggling with self-harm. These preliminary findings are encouraging and provide initial support for the acceptability of BlueIce as a self-help intervention used in conjunction with the traditional face-to-face therapy.",JMIR mental health,Rebecca Grist and Joanna Porter and Paul Stallard,2018,"telemedicine, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, qualitative research, adolescents, self-injurious behavior, mobile apps","030 - Acceptability, Use, and Safety of a Mobile Phone",030,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NA,NOT KNOWN,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,Blue Ice,United Kingdom,25-Suicidal behavior disorder/nonsuicidal self-injury,25,Suicidal behavior disorder/nonsuicidal self-injury,NA,Self-harm,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,QUALITATIVE STUDY,"The participants reported that BlueIce was accessible, easy to use, and convenient.

Article,Adapting a Psychosocial Intervention for Smartphone Delivery to Middle-Aged and Older Adults with Serious Mental Illness,"Objective: To describe the process of adapting an integrated medical and psychiatric self-management intervention to a smartphone application for middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness using an adaptive systems engineering framework and user-centered design. Methods: First, we determined the technical abilities and needs of middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illnesses using smartphones. Then, we developed smartphone content through principles of user-centered design and modified an existing smartphone platform. Finally, we conducted a usability test using â€œthink aloudâ€ and verbal probing. Results: We adapted a psychosocial self-management intervention to a smartphone application and tested its usability. Ten participants (mean age: 55.3 years, SD: 6.2 years) with serious mental illness and comorbid chronic health conditions reported a high level of usability and satisfaction with the smartphone application. Conclusions: Middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness and limited technical abilities were able to participate in a process involving user-centered design and adaptation of a self-management intervention to be delivered by a smartphone. High usability ratings suggest that middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness have the potential to use tailored smartphone interventions.

Article,Adding smartphone-based cognitive-behavior therapy to pharmacotherapy for major depression (FLATT project): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Major depression is one of the most debilitating diseases in terms of quality of life. Less than half of patients suffering from depression can achieve remission after adequate antidepressant treatment. Another promising treatment option is cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). However, the need for experienced therapists and substantive dedicated time prevent CBT from being widely disseminated. In the present study, we aim to examine the effectiveness of switching antidepressants and starting a smartphone-based CBT program at the same time, in comparison to switching antidepressants only, among patients still suffering from depression after adequate antidepressant treatment. Methods/design: A multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted since September 2014. The smartphone-based CBT program, named the â€œKokoro-App,â€ for major depression has been developed and its feasibility has been confirmed in a previous open study. The program consists of an introduction, 6 sessions and an epilogue, and is expected to be completed within 9 weeks by patients. In the present trial, 164 patients with DSM-5 major depressive disorder and still suffering from depressive symptoms after adequate antidepressant treatment for more than 4 weeks will be allocated to the Kokoro-App plus switching antidepressant group or the switching antidepressant alone group. The participants allocated to the latter group will receive full components of the Kokoro-App after 9 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire through the 9 weeks of the program, as assessed at week 0, 1, 5 and 9 via telephone by blinded raters. The secondary outcomes include the change in the total score of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, change in side effects as assessed by the Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating, and treatment satisfaction. Discussion: An effective and reachable intervention may not only lead to healthier mental status among depressed patients, but also to reduced social burden from this illness.

Article,An App a Day Keeps the Doctor Away: Guided Education and Training via Smartphones in Subthreshold Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,"Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are common in military service members (SMs), but stigma can impede treatment initiation. Smartphone applications (apps) are available anywhere, anytime, with the potential to both mitigate the impact of stigma and reduce PTSD symptom severity. We provided 144 SMs or family members, with subthreshold PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist [PCL] scores of 28-49), with apps promoting psychoeducation, social engagement, and relaxation and randomized them to 6 weeks of resilience enhancement (brief cognitive-behavioral session, followed by daily text messages directing app use) or a control group (daily text messages of inspirational quotes). Participants (54 percent males, 87 percent SMs) in both groups reported reductions in PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms during the 6-week intervention, which were sustained at 3 months, but exhibited partial rebound at 6-12 months. Our preliminary results suggest that app use, with or without specific direction, feasibly and effectively reduces symptom severity.

Article,An ecological momentary intervention for smoking cessation: Evaluation of feasibility and effectiveness,"Background: Despite substantial public health progress in reducing the prevalence of smoking in the United States overall, smoking among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults remains high. Objective: To determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a novel smartphone-based smoking cessation app designed for socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. Methods: Participants were recruited from a safety-net hospital smoking cessation clinic in Dallas, Texas, and were followed for 13 weeks. All participants received standard smoking cessation clinic care (ie, group counseling and cessation pharmacotherapy) and a smartphone with a novel smoking cessation app (ie, Smart-T). The Smart-T app prompted 5 daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for 3 weeks (ie, 1 week before cessation and 2 weeks after cessation). During the precessation period, EMAs were followed by messages that focused on planning and preparing for the quit attempt. During the postcessation period, participant responses to EMAs drove an algorithm that tailored messages to the current level of smoking lapse risk and currently present lapse triggers (eg, urge to smoke, stress). Smart-T offered additional intervention features on demand (eg, one-click access to the tobacco cessation quitline; {""}Quit Tips{""} on coping with urges to smoke, mood, and stress). Results: Participants (N=59) were 52.0 (SD 7.0) years old, 54\% (32/59) female, and 53\% (31/59) African American, and 70\% (40/57) had annual household income less than US \$16,000. Participants smoked 20.3 (SD 11.6) cigarettes per day and had been smoking for 31.6 (SD 10.9) years. Twelve weeks after the scheduled quit date, 20\% (12/59) of all participants were biochemically confirmed abstinent. Participants responded to 87\% of all prompted EMAs and received approximately 102 treatment messages over the 3-week EMA period. Most participants (83\%, 49/59) used the on-demand app features. Individuals with greater nicotine dependence and minority race used the Quit Tips feature more than their counterparts. Greater use of the Quit Tips feature was linked to nonabstinence at the 2 (P=.02), 4 (P{\textbackslash}textless.01), and 12 (P=.03) week follow-up visits. Most participants reported that they actually used or implemented the tailored app-generated messages and suggestions (83\%, 49/59); the app-generated messages were helpful (97\%, 57/59); they would like to use the app in the future if they were to lapse (97\%, 57/59); and they would like to refer friends who smoke to use the Smart-T app (85\%, 50/59).

Article,"An ecological momentary intervention for smoking cessation: The associations of just-in-time, tailored messages with lapse risk factors","Background Smartphone apps can provide real-time, tailored interventions for smoking cessation. The current study examines the effectiveness of a smartphone-based smoking cessation application that assessed risk for imminent smoking lapse multiple times per day and provided messages tailored to current smoking lapse risk and specific lapse triggers. Methods Participants (N = 59) recruited from a safety-net hospital smoking cessation clinic completed phone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) 5 times/day for 3 consecutive weeks (1 week pre-quit, 2 weeks post-quit). Risk for smoking lapse was estimated in real-time using a novel weighted lapse risk estimator. With each EMA, participants received messages tailored to current level of risk for imminent smoking lapse and self-reported presence of smoking urge, stress, cigarette availability, and motivation to quit. Generalized linear mixed model analyses determined whether messages tailored to specific lapse risk factors were associated with greater reductions in these triggers than messages not tailored to specific triggers. Results Overall, messages tailored to smoking urge, cigarette availability, or stress corresponded with greater reductions in those triggers than messages that were not tailored to specific triggers (p's = 0.02 to {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Although messages tailored to stress were associated with greater reductions in stress than messages not tailored to stress, the association was non-significant (p = 0.892) when only moments of high stress were included in the analysis. Conclusions Mobile technology can be used to conduct real-time smoking lapse risk assessment and provide tailored treatment content.

Qualitative feedback revealed very high satisfaction with the in-person sessions and suggested a broad range of ways in which the EMI sessions were helpful. Participants also provided suggestions for improving the intervention, which primarily related to the structure and administration of the EMI (smartphone-administered) sessions. Although this study was not designed to evaluate treatment efficacy, most key outcome variables changed in the expected directions from pretreatment to posttreatment, and several variables changed significantly over the course of the in-person sessions or during the EMI phase. These findings add to the small but growing body of literature suggesting that EMIs are feasible and acceptable for use in populations with bipolar disorder. 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Article,App-guided exposure and response prevention for obsessive compulsive disorder: an open pilot trial,"Although effective treatments for obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (OCD) exist, there are significant barriers to receiving evidence-based care. Mobile health applications (Apps) offer a promising way of overcoming these barriers by increasing access to treatment. The current study investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of LiveOCDFree, an App designed to help OCD patients conduct exposure and response prevention (ERP). Twenty-one participants with mild to moderate symptoms of OCD were enrolled in a 12-week open trial of App-guided self-help ERP. Self-report assessments of OCD, depression, anxiety, and quality of life were completed at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. App-guided ERP was a feasible and acceptable self-help intervention for individuals with OCD, with high rates of retention and satisfaction. Participants reported significant improvement in OCD and anxiety symptoms pre- to post-treatment. Findings suggest that LiveOCDFree is a feasible and acceptable self-help intervention for OCD. Preliminary efficacy results are encouraging and point to the potential utility of mobile Apps in expanding the reach of existing empirically supported treatments. 2017 Swedish Association for Behaviour Therapy.",Cognitive Behaviour Therapy,C.L.

Article,Augmenting psychoeducation with a mobile intervention for bipolar disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Background Psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder are frequently unavailable and resource intensive. Mobile technology may improve access to evidence-based interventions and may increase their efficacy. We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of an augmentative mobile ecological momentary intervention targeting self-management of mood symptoms. Methods This was a randomized single-blind controlled trial with 82 consumers diagnosed with bipolar disorder who completed a four-session psychoeducational intervention and were assigned to 10 weeks of either: 1) mobile device delivered interactive intervention linking patient-reported mood states with personalized self-management strategies, or 2) paper-and-pencil mood monitoring. Participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-point), 12 weeks (post-treatment), and 24 weeks (follow up) with clinician-rated depression and mania scales and self-reported functioning. Results Retention at 12 weeks was 93\% and both conditions were associated with high satisfaction. Compared to the paper-and-pencil condition, participants in the augmented mobile intervention condition showed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms at 6 and 12 weeks (Cohen's d for both were d=0.48). However, these effects were not maintained at 24-weeks follow up. Conditions did not differ significantly in the impact on manic symptoms or functional impairment. Limitations This was not a definitive trial and was not powered to detect moderators and mediators.

Article,Barriers and facilitators to mobile application use during PTSD treatment: Clinician adoption of PE coach,"Providers have many options when considering mobile applications (apps) to potentially incorporate into their practice. PE Coach is a patient-facing mobile app developed to support providers and their patients engaged in prolonged exposure (PE) therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Little is known about how providers and their patients use the various features of mental health mobile apps, in general, and PE Coach in particular. This article summarizes findings from qualitative semistructured interviews with 25 PE providers who reported using PE Coach with a total of 450 patients with PTSD. Categories of responses included how providers decided to use PE Coach, aspects and features of PE Coach appreciated, and their perspectives on patient use of the app. Facilitators of PE Coach use included the positive impact of a treatment-companion app on patient perceptions of treatment credibility, the side-by-side collaboration enabled by the app, the consolidation of treatment forms and resources on the patient's phone, and the therapist perceptions of benefits to their patients by app use. Some of the barriers to use included technical challenges, feature differences between the Android and iOS versions of the app, inadequate knowledge of available features, and the lack of an archive of previously completed homework and assessment forms. Results provide useful information about how to better promote the adoption of PE Coach, increase full feature use, improve the app, and could help generate hypotheses for exploring how other behavioral health technologies are used.",Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,G.M.

Article,Beat the Fear of Public Speaking: Mobile 360 degrees Video Virtual Reality Exposure Training in Home Environment Reduces Public Speaking Anxiety,"With this article, we aim to increase our understanding of how mobile virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) can help reduce speaking anxiety. Using the results of a longitudinal study, we examined the effect of a new VRET strategy (Public Speech Trainer, PST), that incorporates 360 degrees live recorded VR environments, on the reduction of public speaking anxiety. The PST was developed as a 360 degrees smartphone application for a VR head-mounted device that participants could use at home. Realistic anxiety experiences were created by means of live 360 degrees video recordings of a lecture hall containing three training sessions based on graded exposure framework; empty classroom (a) and with a small (b) and large audience (c). Thirty-five students participated in all sessions using PST. Anxiety levels were measured before and after each session over a period of 4 weeks. As expected, speaking anxiety significantly decreased after the completion of all PST sessions, and the decrement was the strongest in participants with initially high speaking anxiety baseline levels. Results also revealed that participants with moderate and high speaking anxiety baseline level differ in the anxiety state pattern over time. Conclusively and in line with habituation theory, the results supported the notion that VRET is more effective when aimed at reducing high-state anxiety levels.

Article,Behavioural activation versus mindfulness-based guided self-help treatment administered through a smartphone application: A randomised controlled trial,"Objectives: Evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of two smartphone-delivered treatments: one based on behavioural activation (BA) and other on mindfulness. Design: Parallel randomised controlled, open, trial. Participants were allocated using an online randomisation tool, handled by an independent person who was separate from the staff conducting the study. Setting: General community, with recruitment nationally through mass media and advertisements. Participants: 40 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder received a BA treatment, and 41 participants received a mindfulness treatment. 9 participants were lost at the post-treatment. Intervention: BA: An 8-week long behaviour programme administered via a smartphone application. Mindfulness: An 8-week long mindfulness programme, administered via a smartphone application. Main outcome measures: The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9). Results: 81 participants were randomised (mean age 36.0 years (SD=10.8)) and analysed. Results showed no significant interaction effects of group and time on any of the outcome measures either from pretreatment to post-treatment or from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up.

InProceedings,CBT Assistant: MHealth App for psychotherapy,"Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is psychotherapy recommended for mental disorders such as Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and depression. Wide base of evidence across different studies and clinical practices shows the effectiveness and safety of CBT as compared to other types of treatment. After a face-to-face session with therapists, patients would typically carry out Homework, a central concept to CBT. Patients fill in their worksheets or diaries using pen-and-paper forms between two consecutive face-face sessions with the therapist. Homework provides crucial information about patients to the therapist. In this paper, we discuss mobile support for the delivery of CBT interventions in general, and present an Android app called CBT Assistant that supports behavioral interventions for patients suffering from SAD. CBT Assistant, highly adaptable to the specific context of a given patient. is designed for both therapists and patients, CBT Assistant provides active support for end-to-end CBT protocol including identification of stress or situations that trigger mental problems, assessing their severity, recording and then analyzing the patient's inputs. We believe that CBT Assistant can improve the efficacy of the therapy, and makes the delivery of CBT less taxing for both the therapist and patient. CBT Assistant is designed with input from technologists and therapists. It will be evaluated first by healthy subjects and then by patients receiving CBT at the National University Hospital. 2014 IEEE.",NA,T.Q.Y. Michelle and S. Jarzabek and B.

Article,CBT for depression: a pilot RCT comparing mobile phone vs. computer,"Background: This paper reports the results of a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the delivery modality (mobile phone/tablet or fixed computer) of a cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for the treatment of depression. The aim was to establish whether a previously validated computerized program (The Sadness Program) remained efficacious when delivered via a mobile application. Method: 35 participants were recruited with Major Depression (80\% female) and randomly allocated to access the program using a mobile app (on either a mobile phone or iPad) or a computer. Participants completed 6 lessons, weekly homework assignments, and received weekly email contact from a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist until completion of lesson 2. After lesson 2 email contact was only provided in response to participant request, or in response to a deterioration in psychological distress scores. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Of the 35 participants recruited, 68.6\% completed 6 lessons and 65.7\% completed the 3-months follow up. Attrition was handled using mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA. Results: Both the Mobile and Computer Groups were associated with statistically significantly benefits in the PHQ-9 at post-test.

Article,Clinician Characteristics and Perceptions Related to Use of the PE (Prolonged Exposure) Coach Mobile App,"Using smartphones in the provision of evidence-based psychotherapy holds tremendous potential for enhancing care. Mental health clinicians' perceptions of smartphone-delivered interventions will affect their decision to adopt these promising innovations.

A Web-based survey assessed clinicians' perceptions of the app using diffusion of innovations constructs. Half of the sample practicing PE in the past year reported using PE Coach, with 93.6\% intending to continue using it. For clinicians who did not use PE Coach, 77.6\% intended to use it in the future. Perceptions of PE Coach were generally favorable regarding its relative advantage over current practices, compatibility with clinicians' values and needs, complexity, trialability, and observability.

Article,Cognitive and behavioral skills exercises completed by patients with major depression during smartphone cognitive behavioral therapy: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: A strong and growing body of evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), either face-To-face, in person, or as self-help via the Internet, for depression. However, CBT is a complex intervention consisting of several putatively effective components, and how each component may or may not contribute to the overall effectiveness of CBT is poorly understood. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate how the users of smartphone CBT use and benefit from various components of the program. Methods: This is a secondary analysis from a 9-week, single-blind, randomized controlled trial that has demonstrated the effectiveness of adjunctive use of smartphone CBT (Kokoro-App) over antidepressant pharmacotherapy alone among patients with drug-resistant major depressive disorder (total n=164, standardized mean difference in depression severity at week 9=0.40, J Med Internet Res). Kokoro-App consists of three cognitive behavioral skills of self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring, with corresponding worksheets to fill in. All activities of the participants learning each session of the program and completing each worksheet were uploaded onto Kokoro-Web, which each patient could use for self-check. We examined what use characteristics differentiated the more successful users of the CBT app from the less successful ones, split at the median of change in depression severity. Results: A total of 81 patients with major depression were allocated to the smartphone CBT. On average, they completed 7.0 (standard deviation [SD] 1.4) out of 8 sessions of the program; it took them 10.8 (SD 4.2) days to complete one session, during which they spent 62 min (SD 96) on the app. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of sessions completed, time spent for the program, or the number of completed self-monitoring worksheets between the beneficiaries and the nonbeneficiaries. However, the former completed more behavioral activation tasks, engaged in different types of activities, and also filled in more cognitive restructuring worksheets than the latter. Activities such as {""}test-drive a new car,{""} {""}go to a coffee shop after lunch,{""} or {""}call up an old friend{""} were found to be particularly rewarding. All cognitive restructuring strategies were found to significantly decrease the distress level, with {""}What would be your advice to a friend who has a similar problem?{""} found more helpful than some other strategies. Conclusions: The CBT program offered via smartphone and connected to the remote server is not only effective in alleviating depression but also opens a new avenue in gathering information of what and how each participant may utilize the program. The activities and strategies found useful in this analysis will provide valuable information in brush-ups of the program itself and of mobile health (mHealth) in general.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,T.A.

InProceedings,Cognitive behavioural therapy embedding smoking cessation program using smart phone Technologies,"Smoking cessation programs are widely implemented to assist smokers in the process of quitting smoking. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a psychological approach which is increasingly used in smoking cessation programs. On the other hand, the recent advancements in smartphone technologies have been widely explored to develop smoking cessation apps as a tool to assist with quitting smoking. However, most of existing smartphone apps lack follow up and adherence to clinical guidelines for treatment. Therefore, there is a need for implementing behavioral change mechanisms in smoking cessation apps to help smokers quit effectively.

Article,"Conducting a fully mobile and randomised clinical trial for depression: Access, engagement and expense","Importance Advances in mobile technology have resulted in federal and industry-level initiatives to facilitate large-scale clinical research using smart devices. Although the benefits of technology to expand data collection are obvious, assumptions about the reach of mobile research methods (access), participant willingness to engage in mobile research protocols (engagement), and the cost of this research (cost) remain untested. Objective To assess the feasibility of a fully mobile randomised controlled trial using assessments and treatments delivered entirely through mobile devices to depressed individuals. Design Using a web-based research portal, adult participants with depression who also owned a smart device were screened, consented and randomised to 1 of 3 mental health apps for treatment. Assessments of self-reported mood and cognitive function were conducted at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Physical and social activity was monitored daily using passively collected phone use data. All treatment and assessment tools were housed on each participantâ€™s smart phone or tablet. Interventions A cognitive training application, an application based on problem-solving therapy, and a mobile-sensing application promoting daily activities. Results Access: We screened 2923 people and enrolled 1098 participants in 5 months. The sample characteristics were comparable to the 2013 US census data. Recruitment via Craigslist. org yielded the largest sample. Engagement: Study engagement was high during the first 2 weeks of treatment, falling to 44\% adherence by the 4th week. Cost: The total amount spent on for this project, including staff costs and Î² testing, was \$314 264 over 2 years. Conclusions and relevance These findings suggest that mobile randomised control trials can recruit large numbers of participants in a short period of time and with minimal cost, but study engagement remains challenging. 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

Article,Design and implementation of smartphone application for measurement and management of depressive emotions in adolescents using cognitive behavioral therapy,"This follow-up study examines the development of smartphone application content for measuring and managing youth depression (Park et al. 2016) by designing and implementing a smart phone application that measures and manages depressive emotions in adolescents. This app facilitates specific, individualized analysis of depressive symptoms and a simple, continuous self-check. By avoiding one-time or comprehensive analysis and diagnosis of depression, the app will allow for continuous management of the psychological states. We also aim to provide practical counseling services. To achieve this goal, we examined not only existing studies on youth depression, but also depression-related applications that can be integrated as components of the mobile application. The smartphone application consists largely of tools to facilitate emotional management, anxiety and tension relaxation, changes in negative thinking, and consultation linkage.

Article,"Digital peer-support platform (7Cups) as an adjunct treatment for women with postpartum depression: Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy study","Background: Peer support is considered to be an important framework of support for mothers experiencing postpartum depression (PPD); however, some barriers exist that may limit its use including peer availability and mothersï¿½ lack of time due to child care. Objective: This non-randomized study was designed to examine the feasibility, acceptance, and preliminary clinical outcomes of using 7 Cups of Tea (7Cups), a digital platform that delivers self-help tools and 24/7 emotional support delivered by trained volunteers, as an adjunct treatment for mothers diagnosed with PPD. Methods: Mothers with PPD were referred during intake to the study coach who provided guidance about 7Cups. 7Cups features included self-help tools and chats with trained volunteers who had experienced a perinatal mood disorder in their past. Acceptability was measured by examining self-reports and user engagement with the program. The primary outcome was the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) change score between pre- and postintervention at 2 months, as collected in usual care by clinicians blinded to the study questions. Using a propensity score matching to control for potential confounders, we compared women receiving 7Cups to women receiving treatment as usual (TAU). Results: Participants (n=19) proactively logged into 7Cups for a median of 12 times and 175 minutes. Program use was mostly through the mobile app (median of mobile use 94\%) and between 18:00 and 08:00 when clinicians are unavailable (68\% of total program use time). Participants chatted with volunteers for a total of 3064 minutes and have indicated in their responses 0 instances in which they felt unsafe. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed that 7Cups recipients experienced significant decreases in EPDS scores (P{\textbackslash}textless.001, Cohen d=1.17). No significant difference in EPDS decrease over time was found between 7Cups and TAU, yet the effect size was medium favoring 7Cups (P=.05, Cohen d=0.58). Conclusions: This study supports using a computerized method to train lay people, without any in-person guidance or screening, and engage them with patients diagnosed with mental illness as part of usual care. The medium effect size (d=0.58) favoring the 7Cups group relative to TAU suggests that 7Cups might enhance treatment outcomes. A fully powered trial has to be conducted to examine this effect. ï¿½ Amit Baumel, Amanda Tinkelman, Nandita Mathur, John M Kane.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,A. Baumel and A.

InProceedings,Developing a smartphone application for the Life Enhancement Treatment for Substance Use (LETS act): Designing for motivation and feedback,"The Life Enhancement Treatment for Substance Use (LETS ACT) is a behavioral activation based treatment for comorbid depression and substance use (Daughters et al, 2008). We describe the iterative design process for including motivational and informational attributes in a smartphone application supporting treatment via LETS ACT and LETS ACT-SE (Daughters \& Chen, 2014). Design of the app was uniquely constrained by the need to meet clinical requirements while serving a special population of substance users. The primary goal of LETS ACT is to motivate the user to identify, engage in, and continue engaging in rewarding activities that align with their important life areas, goals, and values, and thus extend the effects of treatment sessions through self-management. In support of this primary goal, the goal of the app is to motivate the user to continue to use the application, and thus to adhere to the primary goal: self-management of treatment. In efficacy studies of LETS ACT and LETS ACT-SE, users could see their progress on paper (Daughters et al, 2008; Magidson et al, 2011) or on a web based platform. How to capitalize on the additional interactive affordances of a standalone smartphone application for this user group was unknown. The two challenges of providing information and motivation were at the core of the app design. Copyright 2015 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",NA,L.A. Matalenas and A.C. McLaughlin and Y.

Article,Development and feasibility of smartphone application for cognitive-behavioural case management of individuals with early psychosis.,"BACKGROUND: This article describes the development of the smartphone application for cognitive-behavioural case management of young individuals with early psychosis and examines the acceptance and potential clinical benefits of this application through a pilot survey.; METHODS: Gwangju Bukgu-Community Mental Health Center developed and launched a smartphone application (Heal Your Mind [HYM]) for cognitive-behavioural case management and symptom monitoring. The HYM application for clients includes 6 main modules including thought record, symptom record, daily life record, official notices, communication and scales. The key module is the {""}thought record{""} for self-directed cognitive-behavioural treatment. When the client writes and sends the self-cognitive-behavioural therapy sheet to the case manager, the latter receives a notification and can provide feedback in real time. We conducted a survey to investigate the acceptance and feasibility of this approach among young clients with early psychosis.; RESULTS: A total of 24 clients with early psychosis participated in this survey. More than 80\% of participants reported that it was easy to learn to use this application, and no one described this application as very complicated or reported that they needed a long time to learn how to use it. About 80\% of participants were satisfied with this application, and 70\% reported that they received help as a result of using this application.; CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that this smartphone application is useful for young individuals with early psychosis and that it may contribute to the development of both young customer- and case manager-friendly systems for this clinical population. 2017 John Wiley \& Sons Australia, Ltd.",Early intervention in psychiatry,Sung-Wan Kim and Ga-Young Lee and Hye-Young Yu and Eun-I.

Article,Development and usability testing of FOCUS: A smartphone system for self-management of schizophrenia.,"Objective: Mobile Health (mHealth) approaches can support the rehabilitation of individuals with psychiatric conditions. In the current article, we describe the development of a smartphone illness self-management system for people with schizophrenia. Methods: The research was conducted with consumers and practitioners at a community-based rehabilitation agency. Stage 1: 904 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed a survey reporting on their current use of mobile devices and interest in mHealth services. Eight practitioners completed a survey examining their attitudes and expectations from an mHealth intervention, and identified needs and potential obstacles. Stage 2: A multidisciplinary team incorporated consumer and practitioner input and employed design principles for the development of e-resources for people with schizophrenia to produce an mHealth intervention. Stage 3: 12 consumers participated in laboratory usability sessions. They performed tasks involved in operating the new system, and provided â€œthink aloudâ€ commentary and post-session usability ratings. Results: 570 (63\%) of survey respondents reported owning a mobile device and many expressed interest in receiving mHealth services. Most practitioners believed that consumers could learn to use and would benefit from an mHealth intervention. In response, we developed a smartphone system that targets medication adherence, mood regulation, sleep, social functioning, and coping with symptoms. Usability testing revealed several design vulnerabilities, and the system was adapted to address consumer needs and preferences accordingly. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Through a comprehensive development process, we produced an mHealth illness self-management intervention that is likely to be used successfully, and is ready for deployment and systemic evaluation in real-world conditions.

Article,Development of a smartphone application for eating disorder self-monitoring,"ObjectiveThis case report aims to (1) describe the development and refinement of a smartphone application for eating disorder self-monitoring; (2) characterize its users in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics; and (3) explore its feasibility and utilization as a self-monitoring tool. MethodWe developed a mobile phone application through which people with eating disorders can self-monitor meals, emotions, behaviors, and thoughts. The application also included positive reinforcement, coping skill suggestions, social support, and feedback components. The app was made available on two Internet app stores. Data include number of downloads and subsequent usage statistics, consumer ratings on app-stores are used as indicators of satisfaction, anonymous aggregate demographic data and Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire scores from 57,940 individuals collected over a two-year period. ResultsThe app demonstrated population-level utilization with over 100,000 users over a two-year period. Almost 50\% percent of users stated that they are not currently receiving clinical treatment and 33\% reported they had not told anyone about their eating disorder. A surprising number of people with severe problems are using the app. DiscussionSmartphone apps have the capacity to reach and engage traditionally underserved individuals with eating disorders at a large scale. Additional work is indicated for the evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of applications for specific user groups and in clinical treatment contexts. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Article,"Digital Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia versus sleep hygiene education: the impact of improved sleep on functional health, quality of life and psychological well-being. Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","Background: Previous research has demonstrated that digital CBT (dCBT), delivered via the Internet, is a scalable and effective intervention for treating insomnia in otherwise healthy adults and leads to significant improvements in primary outcomes relating to sleep. The majority of people with insomnia, however, seek help because of the functional impact and daytime consequences of poor sleep, not because of sleep discontinuity per se. Although some secondary analyses suggest that dCBT may have wider health benefits, no adequately powered study has investigated these as a primary endpoint. This study specifically aims to investigate the impact of dCBT for insomnia upon health and well-being, and will investigate sleep-related changes as mediating factors. Methods/design: We propose a pragmatic, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial of 1000 community participants meeting criteria for insomnia disorder. In the DIALS trial (Digital Insomnia therapy to Assist your Life as well as your Sleep), participants will be randomised to dCBT delivered using web and/or mobile channels (in addition to treatment as usual (TAU)) or to sleep hygiene education (SHE), comprising a website plus a downloadable booklet (in addition to TAU). Online assessments will take place at 0 (baseline), 4 (mid-treatment), 8 (post-treatment), and 24 (follow-up) weeks. At week 25 all participants allocated to SHE will be offered dCBT, at which point the controlled element of the trial will be complete. Naturalistic follow-up will be invited at weeks 36 and 48. Primary outcomes are functional health and well-being at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes are mood, fatigue, sleepiness, cognitive function, productivity and social functioning. All main analyses will be carried out at the end of the final controlled follow-up assessments and will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Further analyses will determine whether observed changes in functional health and well-being are mediated by changes in sleep. The trial is funded by Big Health Ltd.

Article,Ecological Momentary Assessment and Smartphone Application Intervention in Adolescents with Substance Use and Comorbid Severe Psychiatric Disorders: Study Protocol.,"CONTEXT: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent among inpatient adolescents with psychiatric disorders. In this population, substance use and other psychiatric outcomes can reinforce one another. Despite the need for integrated interventions in youths with dual diagnoses, few specific instruments are available. App-based technologies have shown promising results to help reduce substance use in adolescents, but their applicability in youths with associated severe psychiatric disorders is poorly documented. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) intervention for all substance users, and of a smartphone application for cannabis users (Stop-Cannabis), for outpatient treatment after hospital discharge.; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All inpatient adolescents with psychiatric disorders hospitalized between 2016 and 2018 in a university hospital will be systematically screened for SUD and, if positive, will be assessed by an independent specialist addiction team. Participants with confirmed SUDs will be invited and helped to download an EMA app and, if required, the Stop-Cannabis app, the week preceding hospital discharge. Information about the acceptability and use of both apps and the validity of EMA data in comparison to clinical assessments will be assessed after 6months and 1year.; DISCUSSION: This research has been designed to raise specific issues for consideration regarding the sequence between substance use, contextual factors, and other psychiatric symptoms among adolescents with comorbid severe psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved will inform the development of integrated treatment for dual disorders at that age.; ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has already been approved and granted.

Article,Effects of digital Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia on cognitive function: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: The daytime effects of insomnia pose a significant burden to patients and drive treatment seeking. In addition to subjective deficits, meta-analytic data show that patients experience reliable objective impairments across several cognitive domains. While Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective and scalable treatment, we know little about its impact upon cognitive function. Trials of CBT-I have typically used proxy measures for cognitive functioning, such as fatigue or work performance scales, and no study has assessed self-reported impairment in cognitive function as a primary outcome. Moreover, only a small number of studies have assessed objective cognitive performance, pre-to-post CBT-I, with mixed results. This study specifically aims to (1) investigate the impact of CBT-I on cognitive functioning, assessed through both self-reported impairment and objective performance measures, and (2) examine whether change in sleep mediates this impact. Methods/design: We propose a randomised controlled trial of 404 community participants meeting criteria for Insomnia Disorder. In the DISCO trial (Defining the Impact of improved Sleep on COgnitive function (DISCO)) participants will be randomised to digital automated CBT-I delivered by a web and/or mobile platform (in addition to treatment as usual (TAU)) or to a wait-list control (in addition to TAU). Online assessments will take place at 0 (baseline), 10 (posttreatment), and 24 (follow-up) weeks. At week 25, all participants allocated to the wait-list group will be offered digital CBT-I, at which point the controlled element of the trial will be complete. The primary outcome is self-reported cognitive impairment at post-treatment (10 weeks). Secondary outcomes include objective cognitive performance, insomnia severity, sleepiness, fatigue, and self-reported cognitive failures and emotional distress. All main analyses will be carried out on completion of follow-up assessments and will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Further analyses will determine to what extent observed changes in self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive performance are mediated by changes in sleep. The trial is supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) based at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Oxford, and by the NIHR Oxford Health BRC.

Article,Efficacy of a hybrid online training for panic symptoms and agoraphobia: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Recently, internet-based interventions have been proposed as effective treatments for people with panic disorder (PD). However, little is known about the clinical effects of integrating mobile technology into these interventions. Because users carry their smartphones with them throughout the day, we hypothesize that this technology can be used to significantly support individuals with monitoring and overcoming their PD symptoms. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed hybrid intervention that combines internet/PC with smartphone delivery to treat the symptoms of PD. The intervention is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and consists of six modules over a total of six weeks. Methods/Design: A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the effects of a hybrid online training module for PD. Based on a power calculation (d =0.60; 1-Î² of 80\%; aÎ± =0.05), 90 participants with mild to moderate panic symptoms with or without agoraphobia (as assessed by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale) will be recruited from the general population and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group. The primary outcome measure will be the severity of panic symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include depression, quality of life, and an observer-based rating of panic severity. Furthermore, data regarding acceptance and the usability of the smartphone app will be assessed. Assessments will take place at baseline as well as eight weeks, three months, and six months after randomization. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from a societal perspective. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. Discussion: To our knowledge, this RCT is one of the first to examine the efficacy of a hybrid online training for adult PD. This study seeks to contribute to the emerging field of hybrid online training. If the intervention is efficacious, then research on this hybrid online training should be extended. The cost-effectiveness analysis will also indicate whether online training is an economical tool for treating PD among adults.

Article,Exploring User Learnability and Learning Performance in an App for Depression: Usability Study.,"BACKGROUND: Mental health apps tend to be narrow in their functioning, with their focus mostly being on tracking, management, or psychoeducation. It is unclear what capability such apps have to facilitate a change in users, particularly in terms of learning key constructs relating to behavioral interventions. Thought Challenger (CBITs, Chicago) is a skill-building app that engages users in cognitive restructuring, a core component of cognitive therapy (CT) for depression.; OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the learnability and learning performance of users following initial use of Thought Challenger.; METHODS: Twenty adults completed in-lab usability testing of Thought Challenger, which comprised two interactions with the app. Learnability was measured via completion times, error rates, and psychologist ratings of user entries in the app; learning performance was measured via a test of CT knowledge and skills. Nonparametric tests were conducted to evaluate the difference between individuals with no or mild depression to those with moderate to severe depression, as well as differences in completion times and pre- and posttests.; RESULTS: Across the two interactions, the majority of completion times were found to be acceptable (5 min or less), with minimal errors (1.2\%, 10/840) and successful completion of CT thought records. Furthermore, CT knowledge and skills significantly improved after the initial use of Thought Challenger (P=.009).; CONCLUSIONS: The learning objectives for Thought Challenger during initial uses were successfully met in an evaluation with likely end users.

Article,Feasibility of PRIME: A Cognitive Neuroscience-Informed Mobile App Intervention to Enhance Motivated Behavior and Improve Quality of Life in Recent Onset Schizophrenia,"Background: Despite improvements in treating psychosis, schizophrenia remains a chronic and debilitating disorder that affects approximately 1\% of the US population and costs society more than depression, dementia, and other medical illnesses across most of the lifespan. Improving functioning early in the course of illness could have significant implications for long-term outcome of individuals with schizophrenia. Yet, current gold-standard treatments do not lead to clinically meaningful improvements in outcome, partly due to the inherent challenges of treating a population with significant cognitive and motivational impairments. The rise of technology presents an opportunity to develop novel treatments that may circumvent the motivational and cognitive challenges observed in schizophrenia. Objective: The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a Personalized Real-Time Intervention for Motivation Enhancement (PRIME), a mobile app intervention designed to target reward-processing impairments, enhance motivation, and thereby improve quality of life in recent onset schizophrenia, and (2) evaluate the empirical benefits of using an iterative, user-centered design (UCD) process. Methods: We conducted two design workshops with 15 key stakeholders, followed by a series of in-depth interviews in collaboration with IDEO, a design and innovation firm. The UCD approach ultimately resulted in the first iteration of PRIME, which was evaluated by 10 RO participants. Results from the Stage 1 participants were then used to guide the next iteration that is currently being evaluated in an ongoing RCT. Participants in both phases were encouraged to use the app daily with a minimum frequency of 1/week over a 12-week period. Results: The UCD process resulted in the following feature set: (1) delivery of text message (short message service, SMS)-based motivational coaching from trained therapists, (2) individualized goal setting in prognostically important psychosocial domains, (3) social networking via direct peer-to-peer messaging, and (4) community â€œmoments feedâ€ to capture and reinforce rewarding experiences and goal achievements. Users preferred an experience that highlighted several of the principles of self-determination theory, including the desire for more control of their future (autonomy and competence) and an approach that helps them improve existing relationships (relatedness). IDEO, also recommended an approach that was casual, friendly, and nonstigmatizing, which is in line with the recovery model of psychosis. After 12-weeks of using PRIME, participants used the app, on average, every other day, were actively engaged with its various features each time they logged in and retention and satisfaction was high (20/20, 100\% retention, high satisfaction ratings). The iterative design process lead to a 2- to 3-fold increase in engagement from Stage 1 to Stage 2 in almost each aspect of the platform.

Article,"Feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the PTSD coach app: A pilot randomized controlled trial with community trauma survivors","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health concern. Although effective treatments exist, affected individuals face many barriers to receiving traditional care. Smartphones are carried by nearly 2 thirds of the U.S. population, offering a promising new option to overcome many of these barriers by delivering self-help interventions through applications (apps). As there is limited research on apps for trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms, we conducted a pilot feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy trial of PTSD Coach, a self-management smartphone app for PTSD. Method: A community sample of trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms (N = 49) were randomized to 1 month using PTSD Coach or a waitlist condition. Self-report assessments were completed at baseline, postcondition, and 1-month follow-up. Following the postcondition assessment, waitlist participants were crossed-over to receive PTSD Coach. Results: Participants reported using the app several times per week, throughout the day across multiple contexts, and endorsed few barriers to use. Participants also reported that PTSD Coach components were moderately helpful and that they had learned tools and skills from the app to manage their symptoms. Between conditions effect size estimates were modest (d =-0.25 to-0.33) for PTSD symptom improvement, but not statistically significant. Conclusions: Findings suggest that PTSD Coach is a feasible and acceptable intervention.

Article,"Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone intervention for schizophrenia","The FOCUS smartphone intervention was developed to provide automated real-time/real-place illness management support to individuals with schizophrenia. The system was specifically designed to be usable by people with psychotic disorders who may have cognitive impairment, psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, and/or low reading levels. FOCUS offers users both prescheduled and on-demand resources to facilitate symptom management, mood regulation, medication adherence, social functioning, and improved sleep. In this study, 33 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder used FOCUS over a 1-month period in their own environments. Participants were able to learn how to use the intervention independently, and all but one participant completed the trial successfully and returned the smartphones intact. Completers used the system on 86.5\% of days they had the device, an average of 5.2 times a day. Approximately 62\% of use of the FOCUS intervention was initiated by the participants, and 38\% of use was in response to automated prompts. Baseline levels of cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, persecutory ideation, and reading level were not related to participants' use of the intervention. Approximately 90\% of participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable and usable.

Article,GETSmart: Guided education and training via smart phones to promote resilience.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in U.S. military service members (SMs) returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. SMs with PTSD symptoms that fall short of meeting full diagnostic criteria also experience devastating effects on their quality of life and daily functioning. Though evidence based treatments are indicated for those meeting diagnostic criteria, less attention has been given to interventions for those with subthreshold symptoms. The advent of novel technologies affords a unique opportunity to meet these intervention needs. Here we describe the feasibility and preliminary findings testing a smartphone-based intervention program to reduce PTSD symptoms in post-deployment SMs. Participants were randomized to a control or intervention condition. Those in the intervention condition engaged in one Skype session and six weeks of daily directive text messages guiding application (app) use. Apps primarily included those developed by the Department of Defense or VA. Participants completed the PTSD Checklist online at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Overall, participant feedback was positive, regardless of treatment condition. Preliminary findings (with 10\% of the overall target population having enrolled) indicate PCL scores decrease significantly from baseline to post-intervention, and these effects are maintained at 3-month follow-up. Additional analyses will be performed upon completion of the study. The present findings demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone-based resiliency training program for those with subthreshold PTSD.

Article,Guided and unguided CBT for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder via the Internet and a smartphone application: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Smartphone technology presents a novel and promising opportunity to extend the reach of psychotherapeutic interventions by moving selected parts of the therapy into the real-life situations causing distress. This randomised controlled trial will investigate the effects of a transdiagnostic, Internet-administered cognitive behavioural (iCBT) self-help program for anxiety, supplemented with a smartphone application. The effect of added therapist support will also be studied. Methods/Design: One hundred and fifty participants meeting diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder will be evenly randomised to either one of three study groups: 1, smartphone-supplemented iCBT with therapist support; 2, smartphone-supplemented iCBT without therapist support; or 3, an active waiting list control group with delayed treatment. Primary outcome measure will be the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item self-rating scale. Secondary measures include other anxiety, depression and quality of life measures. In addition to pre- and post-treatment measurements, the study includes two mid-treatment (days 24 and 48) and two follow-up assessments (12 and 36 months) to assess rapid and long-term effects. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of smartphone-supplemented iCBT for anxiety disorders. Hence, the findings from this trial will constitute great advancements in the burgeoning and promising field of smartphone-administered psychological interventions. Limitations are discussed.

Article,Ibobbly mobile health intervention for suicide prevention in Australian Indigenous youth: A pilot randomised controlled trial,"Objectives: Rates of youth suicide in Australian Indigenous communities are 4 times the national youth average and demand innovative interventions. Historical and persistent disadvantage is coupled with multiple barriers to help seeking. Mobile phone applications offer the opportunity to deliver therapeutic interventions directly to individuals in remote communities. The pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-help mobile app (ibobbly) targeting suicidal ideation, depression, psychological distress and impulsivity among Indigenous youth in remote Australia. Setting: Remote and very remote communities in the Kimberley region of North Western Australia. Participants: Indigenous Australians aged 18-35 years. Interventions: 61 participants were recruited and randomised to receive either an app (ibobbly) which delivered acceptance-based therapy over 6 weeks or were waitlisted for 6 weeks and then received the app for the following 6 weeks. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome was the Depressive Symptom Inventory -Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS) to identify the frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation in the previous weeks. Secondary outcomes were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11). Results: Although preintervention and postintervention changes on the (DSI-SS) were significant in the ibobbly arm (t=2.40; df=58.1; p=0.0195), these differences were not significant compared with the waitlist arm (t=1.05; df=57.8; p=0.2962). However, participants in the ibobbly group showed substantial and statistically significant reductions in PHQ-9 and K10 scores compared with waitlist. No differences were observed in impulsivity. Waitlist participants improved after 6 weeks of app use. Conclusions: Apps for suicide prevention reduce distress and depression but do not show significant reductions on suicide ideation or impulsivity. A feasible and acceptable means of lowering symptoms for mental health disorders in remote communities is via appropriately designed self-help apps. 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",BMJ Open,J.

Article,"Impact of a mobile phone and web program on symptom and functional outcomes for people with mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety and stress: A randomised controlled trial","Background: Mobile phone-based psychological interventions enable real time self-monitoring and self-management, and large-scale dissemination. However, few studies have focussed on mild-to-moderate symptoms where public health need is greatest, and none have targeted work and social functioning. This study reports outcomes of a CONSORT-compliant randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of myCompass, a self-guided psychological treatment delivered via mobile phone and computer, designed to reduce mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety and stress, and improve work and social functioning.Method: Community-based volunteers with mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety and/or stress (N = 720) were randomly assigned to the myCompass program, an attention control intervention, or to a waitlist condition for seven weeks. The interventions were fully automated, without any human input or guidance. Participants' symptoms and functioning were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up, using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale.Results: Retention rates at post-intervention and follow-up for the study sample were 72.1\% (n = 449) and 48.6\% (n = 350) respectively. The myCompass group showed significantly greater improvement in symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress and in work and social functioning relative to both control conditions at the end of the 7-week intervention phase (between-group effect sizes ranged from d = .22 to d = .55 based on the observed means). Symptom scores remained at near normal levels at 3-month follow-up. Participants in the attention control condition showed gradual symptom improvement during the post-intervention phase and their scores did not differ from the myCompass group at 3-month follow-up.Conclusions: The myCompass program is an effective public health program, facilitating rapid improvements in symptoms and in work and social functioning for individuals with mild-to-moderate mental health problems.Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN 12610000625077. 2013 Proudfoot et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",BMC Psychiatry,J.

Article,Implementing a Mobile Health System to Integrate the Treatment of Addiction Into Primary Care: A Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness Study,"Background: Despite the near ubiquity of mobile phones, little research has been conducted on the implementation of mobile health (mHealth) apps to treat patients in primary care. Although primary care clinicians routinely treat chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes, they rarely treat addiction, a common chronic condition. Instead, addiction is most often treated in the US health care system, if it is treated at all, in a separate behavioral health system. mHealth could help integrate addiction treatment in primary care. Objective: The objective of this paper was to report the effects of implementing an mHealth system for addiction in primary care on both patients and clinicians. Methods: In this implementation research trial, an evidence-based mHealth system named Seva was introduced sequentially over 36 months to a maximum of 100 patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) in each of three federally qualified health centers (FQHCs; primary care clinics that serve patients regardless of their ability to pay). This paper reports on patient and clinician outcomes organized according to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Results: The outcomes according to the RE-AIM framework are as follows: Reach-Seva reached 8.31\% (268/3226) of appropriate patients. Reach was limited by our ability to pay for phones and data plans for a maximum of 100 patients per clinic. Effectiveness-Patients who were given Seva had significant improvements in their risky drinking days (44\% reduction, (0.7-1.25)/1.25, P=.04), illicit drug-use days (34\% reduction, (2.14-3.22)/3.22, P=.01), quality of life, human immunodeficiency virus screening rates, and number of hospitalizations. Through Seva, patients also provided peer support to one another in ways that are novel in primary care settings. Adoption-Patients sustained high levels of Seva use-between 53\% and 60\% of the patients at the 3 sites accessed Seva during the last week of the 12-month implementation period. Among clinicians, use of the technology was less robust than use by patients, with only a handful of clinicians using Seva in each clinic and behavioral health providers making most referrals to Seva in 2 of the 3 clinics. Implementation-At 2 sites, implementation plans were realized successfully; they were delayed in the third. Maintenance-Use of Seva dropped when grant funding stopped paying for the mobile phones and data plans. Two of the 3 clinics wanted to maintain the use of Seva, but they struggled to find funding to support this. Conclusions: Implementing an mHealth system can improve care among primary care patients with SUDs, and patients using the system can support one another in their recovery. Among clinicians, however, implementation requires figuring out how information from the mHealth system will be used and making mHealth data available in the electronic health (eHealth) record. In addition, paying for an mHealth system remains a challenge.",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,Andrew Quanbeck and David H. Gustafson and Lisa A.

Article,"Intellicare: An eclectic, skills-based app suite for the treatment of depression and anxiety","Background: Digital mental health tools have tended to use psychoeducational strategies based on treatment orientations developed and validated outside of digital health. These features do not map well to the brief but frequent ways that people use mobile phones and mobile phone apps today. To address these challenges, we developed a suite of apps for depression and anxiety called IntelliCare, each developed with a focused goal and interactional style. IntelliCare apps prioritize interactive skills training over education and are designed for frequent but short interactions. Objective: The overall objective of this study was to pilot a coach-assisted version of IntelliCare and evaluate its use and efficacy at reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: Participants, recruited through a health care system, Web-based and community advertising, and clinical research registries, were included in this single-arm trial if they had elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety. Participants had access to the 14 IntelliCare apps from Google Play and received 8 weeks of coaching on the use of IntelliCare. Coaching included an initial phone call plus 2 or more texts per week over the 8 weeks, with some participants receiving an additional brief phone call. Primary outcomes included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. Participants were compensated up to US \$90 for completing all assessments; compensation was not for app use or treatment engagement. Results: Of the 99 participants who initiated treatment, 90.1\% (90/99) completed 8 weeks. Participants showed substantial reductions in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (P{\textbackslash}textless.001). Participants used the apps an average of 195.4 (SD 141) times over the 8 weeks. The average length of use was 1.1 (SD 2.1) minutes, and 95\% of participants downloaded 5 or more of the IntelliCare apps. Conclusions: This study supports the IntelliCare framework of providing a suite of skills-focused apps that can be used frequently and briefly to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. The IntelliCare system is elemental, allowing individual apps to be used or not used based on their effectiveness and utility, and it is eclectic, viewing treatment strategies as elements that can be applied as needed rather than adhering to a singular, overarching, theoretical model.

Article,Is a SIMPLe smartphone application capable of improving biological rhythms in bipolar disorder?,"Background: Biological rhythms (BR) disturbance has been suggested as a potential mediator of mood episodes in Bipolar Disorder (BD). The Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) was designed as an assessment tool to evaluate BR domains comprehensively. In the context of a trial evaluating a smartphone application delivering personalized psychoeducational contents for BD (SIMPLe 1.0), the main aim of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of SIMPLe 1.0 in BR regulation using the BRIAN scale. Methods: 51 remitted BD patients were asked to use the application for 3 months. Paired t-test analyses were employed to compare baseline and follow-up BRIAN's total and domains scores. The sample was divided into completers and non-completers of the study to evaluate differences between groups regarding BRIAN scores using ANCOVA analyses. Results: The BRIAN's mean total score of the whole sample significantly decreased from baseline to post-intervention (35.89 (SD 6.64) vs. 31.18 (SD 6.33), t = 4.29, p = 0.001). At post-intervention, there was a significant difference between groups regarding the total BRIAN mean score (29.47 (SD 6.21) completers vs. 35.92 (SD 3.90) non-completers, t = 2.50, p = 0.02). This difference was maintained after conducting a one-way ANCOVA controlling for pre-intervention BRIAN scores, F (1, 46) = 10.545, p = 0.002. Limitations: A limited sample, pre-post measures, and a short study timeframe could have affected the results. Additional factors affecting BR, such as medication, could not be ruled out. Conclusion: Our results suggest that there are potential positive effects of a psychoeducational smartphone application as an adjunctive to treatment as usual on BD patients' BR.",JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,Diego Hidalgo-Mazzei and Maria Reinares and Ainoa Mateu and Mario F.

InProceedings,LifePal: A Mobile Self-management Tool for Supporting Young People with Autism,"People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) cope with a life-long condition that can affect communication skills and social interaction. This can lead to feelings of social anxiety, depression and isolation, especially among young adults with ASD. One strategy to support the needs of people with ASD is to facilitate proper structure and organization in the person's daily life. This paper presents a technology solution that promotes a self-management paradigm towards empowering people with ASD to enhance their independence and life skills. `LifePal' is a smartphone App that provides users with task management, life-logging, reminding, and travel support. The App is supported via a dedicated web portal that promotes collaboration between caregivers and their dependents, towards defining obtainable life goals. The paper presents implementation details of the core platform services and discusses the results from a two-stage evaluation, conducted over a period of 6 months. Based on the feedback from 20 participants (4 parents (Phase one), 8 child-parent groupings (Phase two)), the findings positively support the potential utility of LifePal, however, highlight the importance of delivering sufficient user training to support adoption.",NA,K. -L.

InProceedings,MedLink: A mobile intervention to address failure points in the treatment of depression in general medicine,"Major depression is common, and imposes a high burden in terms of cost, morbidity, and suffering. Most people with depression are treated in general medicine using antidepressant medication. Outcomes are poor due to failure points across the care system, including patient non-adherence, failure of physicians to optimize the treatment regimens, and lack of patient-physician communication. This study reports on the 4-week pilot deployment of MedLink, a mobile intervention aimed at systemically addressing each of these failure points. A mobile app provides the patient with information and collects data on symptoms and side-effects. A cellularly enabled pill bottle monitors medication adherence. Data from these are provided to the physician and patient to foster communication and medication adjustments. Usability evaluation was generally favorable. Medication adherence rates in this first deployment were high with no patients discontinuing, and 84\% of doses taken. Depressive symptom severity was significantly reduced. This study supports the use of a comprehensive, systemic approach to mHealth solutions to enhance processes of care for depression by general medicine physicians. 2015 ICST.",NA,D.C. Mohr and E.

Article,"mHealth in the Wild: Using Novel Data to Examine the Reach, Use, and Impact of PTSD Coach","Background: A majority of Americans (58\%) now use smartphones, making it possible for mobile mental health apps to reach large numbers of those who are living with untreated, or under-treated, mental health symptoms. Although early trials suggest positive effects for mobile health (mHealth) interventions, little is known about the potential public health impact of mobile mental health apps. Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize reach, use, and impact of â€œPTSD Coachâ€, a free, broadly disseminated mental health app for managing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Methods: Using a mixed-methods approach, aggregate mobile analytics data from 153,834 downloads of PTSD Coach were analyzed in conjunction with 156 user reviews. Results: Over 60\% of users engaged with PTSD Coach on multiple occasions (mean=6.3 sessions). User reviews reflected gratitude for the availability of the app and being able to use the app specifically during moments of need. PTSD Coach users reported relatively high levels of trauma symptoms (mean PTSD Checklist Score=57.2, SD=15.7). For users who chose to use a symptom management tool, distress declined significantly for both first-time users (mean=1.6 points, SD=2.6 on the 10-point distress thermometer) and return-visit users (mean=2.0, SD=2.3). Analysis of app session data identified common points of attrition, with only 80\% of first-time users reaching the app's home screen and 37\% accessing one of the app's primary content areas. Conclusions: These findings suggest that PTSD Coach has achieved substantial and sustained reach in the population, is being used as intended, and has been favorably received. PTSD Coach is a unique platform for the delivery of mobile mental health education and treatment, and continuing evaluation and improvement of the app could further strengthen its public health impact.",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,Jason E.

Article,Mobile and traditional cognitive behavioral therapy programs for generalized anxiety disorder: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a debilitating mental health illness that affects approximately 3.1\% of U.S. adults and can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). With the emergence of digital health technologies, mobile CBT may be a cost-effective way to deliver care. We developed an analysis framework to quantify the cost-effectiveness of internet-based CBT for individuals with GAD. As a case study, we examined the potential value of a new mobile-delivered CBT program for GAD. Methods We developed a Markov model of GAD health states combined with a detailed economic analysis for a cohort of adults with GAD in the U.S. In our case study, we used pilot program efficacy data to evaluate a mobile CBT program as either prevention or treatment only and compared the strategies to traditional CBT and no CBT. Traditional CBT efficacy was estimated from clinical trial results. We calculated discounted incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over the cohort lifetime. Case study results In the base case, for a cohort of 100,000 persons with GAD, we found that mobile CBT is cost-saving. It leads to a gain of 34,108 QALYs and 81,492 QALYs and a cost reduction of \$2.23 billion and \$4.54 billion when compared to traditional CBT and no CBT respectively. Results were insensitive to most model inputs and mobile CBT remained cost-saving in almost all scenarios. Limitations The case study was conducted for illustrative purposes and used mobile CBT efficacy data from a small pilot program; the analysis should be re-conducted once robust efficacy data is available. The model was limited in its ability to measure the effectiveness of CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy. Conclusions Mobile CBT may lead to improved health outcomes at lower costs than traditional CBT or no intervention and may be effective as either prevention or treatment. 2018 Kumar et al.

Article,Mobile Health Technology Using a Wearable Sensorband for Female College Students With Problem Drinking: An Acceptability and Feasibility Study.,"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of mobile app interventions have been developed for problem drinking among college students; however, few studies have examined the integration of a mobile app with continuous physiological monitoring and alerting of affective states related to drinking behaviors.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of Mind the Moment (MtM), a theoretically based intervention for female college students with problem drinking that combines brief, in-person counseling with ecological momentary intervention (EMI) on a mobile app integrated with a wearable sensorband.; METHODS: We recruited 10 non-treatment seeking, female undergraduates from a university health clinic who scored a 3 or higher on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) to participate in this pilot study. Study activities involved an in-person baseline intake and 1 follow-up assessment, 2 in-person alcohol brief intervention counseling sessions, and use of MtM technology components (sensorband and EMI on a mobile app) for approximately 3-4 weeks. The intervention used motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies for reducing risks associated with drinking. We used both qualitative and quantitative assessments to measure acceptability of the intervention and feasibility of delivery. Use patterns of the sensorband and mobile app were also collected.; RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative data indicated high levels of acceptability for the MtM intervention. Altogether, participants made reports on the app on 26.7\% (78/292) the days the technology was available to them and completed a total of 325 reports with wide variation between participants. Qualitative findings indicated that sensorband-elicited alerts promoted an increase in awareness of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to current environmental stressors and drinking behaviors in theoretically meaningful ways. Specific challenges related to functionality and form of the sensorband were identified.; CONCLUSIONS: Delivering intervention material {""}just-in-time,{""} at the moment participants need to use behavioral strategies has great potential to individualize behavioral interventions for reducing problem drinking and other health behaviors.

Article,Mobile Mindfulness Intervention on an Acute Psychiatric Unit: Feasibility and Acceptability Study,"Background: Aggression and violence on acute psychiatric inpatient units is extensive and leads to negative sequelae for staff and patients. With increasingly acute inpatient milieus due to shorter lengths of stay, inpatient staff is limited in training and time to be able to provide treatments. Mobile technology provides a new platform for offering treatment on such units, but it has not been tested for feasibility or usability in this particular setting. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a brief mindfulness meditation mobile phone app intended to reduce anger and aggression in acute psychiatric inpatients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, and a history of violence. Methods: Participants were recruited between November 1, 2015 and June 1, 2016. A total of 13 inpatients at an acute care state hospital carried mobile phones for 1 week and were asked to try a commercially available mindfulness app called Headspace. The participants completed a usability questionnaire and engaged in a qualitative interview upon completion of the 7 days. In addition, measures of mindfulness, state and trait anger, and cognitive ability were administered before and after the intervention. Results: Of the 13 enrolled participants, 10 used the app for the 7 days of the study and completed all measures. Two additional participants used the app for fewer than 7 days and completed all measures. All participants found the app to be engaging and easy to use. Most (10/12, 83\%) felt comfortable using Headspace and 83\% (10/12) would recommend it to others. All participants made some effort to try the app, with 6 participants (6/12, 50\%) completing the first 10 10-minute â€œfoundationâ€ guided meditations. Conclusions: This is the first known study of the use of a commercially available app as an intervention on acute psychiatric inpatient units. Acutely ill psychiatric inpatients at a state hospital found the Headspace app easy to use, were able to complete a series of meditations, and felt the app helped with anxiety, sleep, and boredom on the unit. There were no instances of an increase in psychotic symptoms reported and there were no episodes of aggression or violence noted in the record.",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,Lisa A.

Article,Mobile phone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: A randomized waitlist controlled trial,"Background: This study is one of the first randomized controlled trials investigating cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered by a fully automated mobile phone app. Such an app can potentially increase the accessibility of insomnia treatment for the 10\% of people who have insomnia. Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy of CBT-I delivered via the Sleepcare mobile phone app, compared with a waitlist control group, in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: We recruited participants in the Netherlands with relatively mild insomnia disorder. After answering an online pretest questionnaire, they were randomly assigned to the app (n=74) or the waitlist condition (n=77). The app packaged a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise, sleep restriction exercise, and sleep hygiene and education. The app was fully automated and adjusted itself to a participant's progress. Program duration was 6 to 7 weeks, after which participants received posttest measurements and a 3-month follow-up. The participants in the waitlist condition received the app after they completed the posttest questionnaire. The measurements consisted of questionnaires and 7-day online diaries. The questionnaires measured insomnia severity, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The diary measured sleep variables such as sleep efficiency. We performed multilevel analyses to study the interaction effects between time and condition. Results: The results showed significant interaction effects (P{\textbackslash}textless.01) favoring the app condition on the primary outcome measures of insomnia severity (d=-0.66) and sleep efficiency (d=0.71). Overall, these improvements were also retained in a 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the efficacy of a fully automated mobile phone app in the treatment of relatively mild insomnia. The effects were in the range of what is found for Web-based treatment in general. This supports the applicability of such technical tools in the treatment of insomnia. Future work should examine the generalizability to a more diverse population. Furthermore, the separate components of such an app should be investigated. It remains to be seen how this app can best be integrated into the current health regimens.

Article,Mobile Sensing and Support for People With Depression: A Pilot Trial in the Wild,"Background: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support. Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery. Results: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for {\textbackslash}textgreater= 2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9 {\textbackslash}textgreater= 11) at baseline and adherence {\textbackslash}textgreater= 8 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=-.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9 {\textbackslash}textgreater= 11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1\% and 59.1\% accuracy, respectively. Conclusions: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,Fabian Wahle and Tobias Kowatsch and Elgar Fleisch and Michael Rufer and Steffi Weidt,2016,"cognitive behavioral therapy, depression, mHealth, classification, activities of daily living, context awareness",183 - Mobile Sensing and Support for People,183,YES,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,NOT KNOWN,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,Mobile Sensing and Support,Switzerland,4-Depressive disorders,4,Depressive disorders,NA,Depression,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,"PILOT TRIAL, MONOCENTRIC, SINGLE-ARM CLINICAL PILOT STUDY",NA,126,"126, pero esto es difícil cuántos son los definitivos, ver página 10","solo una, la dela intervención",YES,EFFECT,NO,Switzerland
Article,Mobile-application based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for identifying and managing depression and anxiety,"Mobile technology is a cost effective and scalable platform for developing a therapeutic intervention. This paper discusses the development of a mobile application for people suffering with depression and anxiety. The application which we have developed is similar to a Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) website, which is freely available on the internet. Past research has shown that CBT delivered over the internet is effective in alleviating the depressive symptoms in users. But, this delivery method is associated with some innate drawbacks, which caused user dropout and reduced adherence to the therapy. To overcome these shortfalls, from web based CBT delivery, a mobile application called MoodTrainer was developed. The application is equipped with mobile specific interventions and CBT modules which aim at delivering a dynamic supportive psychotherapy to the user. The mobile specific interventions using this application ensures that the user is constantly engaged with the application and focused to change the negative thought process. We present MoodTrainer as a self-efficacy tool and virtual CBT that is not meant to replace a clinical caregiver.

Article,MoodHacker Mobile Web App With Email for Adults to Self-Manage Mild-to-Moderate Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause of disease burden and is projected to be the second leading cause of disability by 2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States are estimated at US \$210.5 billion, with employers bearing over 50\% of these costs in productivity loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because most adults with depression never receive treatment, there is a need to develop effective interventions that can be more widely disseminated through new channels, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), and directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face care. Objective: This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the MoodHacker mobile Web app to activate the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression. It was hypothesized that MoodHacker users would experience reduced depression symptoms and negative cognitions, and increased behavioral activation, knowledge of depression, and functioning in the workplace. Methods: A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted with 300 employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate depression. Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in partnership with an EAP and with outreach through a variety of additional non-EAP organizations. Participants were blocked on race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned within each block to receive, without clinical support, either the MoodHacker intervention (n=150) or alternative care consisting of links to vetted websites on depression (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online self-assessment surveys at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral activation, (3) negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction and usability. After randomization, all interactions with subjects were automated with the exception of safety-related follow-up calls to subjects reporting current suicidal ideation and/or severe depression symptoms. Results: At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on depression, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded significant effects on depression symptoms, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress for those who reported access to an EAP, but no significant effects on these outcome measures for those without EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used the MoodHacker app an average of 16.0 times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 1.3 hours (SD 1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant effects on work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up. Conclusions: This randomized effectiveness trial found that the MoodHacker app produced significant effects on depression symptoms (partial eta(2) = .021) among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when compared to subjects with access to relevant depression Internet sites. The app had stronger effects for individuals with access to an EAP (partial eta(2) = .093). For all users, the MoodHacker program also yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as the mediating factors of behavioral activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge of depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week follow-up for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week follow-up underscores the importance of extending program contacts to maintain user engagement. This study suggests that light-touch, CBT-based mobile interventions like MoodHacker may be appropriate for implementation within EAPs and similar environments. In addition, it seems likely that supporting MoodHacker users with guidance from counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person support.",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,Amelia J.

Article,Moodivate: A self-help behavioral activation mobile app for utilization in primary care-Development and clinical considerations,"Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent and are associated with considerable functional impairment, significant public health costs, and heightened mortality risk. Individuals experiencing impairment due to depressive symptomatology are most likely to report their symptoms to a primary care provider. As such, national guidelines highlight the need to assess and effectively treat depression via primary care. Despite these guidelines, the dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapy via primary care is limited, likely due to both provider- and patient-level treatment barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are promising for addressing these barriers and for promoting uptake of evidence-based depression treatment. Among evidence-based psychotherapies for depression, brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) has shown great promise and is particularly amenable to mHealth delivery. Herein, we discuss the development of a BATD mobile application, Moodivate, that was developed in order to disseminate BATD via primary care. This paper focuses on description of (1) rationale for Moodivate treatment development, (2) Moodivate treatment components, (3) ongoing clinical trial evaluation of Moodivate, and (4) clinical considerations for incorporating Moodivate into clinical practice.

Article,Multimedia Field Test Thinking About Exposures? There's an App for That!,"Anxiety Coach is a smartphone application ({""}app{""}) for iOS devices that is billed as a self-help program for anxiety in youth and adults. The app is currently available in the iTunes store for a one-time fee of \$4.99. Anxiety Coach is organized around three related content areas: (a) self-monitoring of anxiety symptoms, (b) learning about anxiety and its treatment, and (c) guiding users through the development of a fear hierarchy and completion of exposure tasks. Although the app includes psychoeducation about anxiety as well as information regarding specific skills individuals can use to cope with anxiety (e.g., cognitive restructuring), the primary focus of the app is on exposure tasks. As such, the app includes a large library of potential exposure tasks that are relevant to treating common fears and worries, making Anxiety Coach useful to clients and clinicians alike. Additionally, Anxiety Coach prompts users to provide fear ratings while they are carrying out an exposure task and displays a message instructing users to stop the exposure once fear ratings drop by half. These features work together to create an app that has the potential to greatly increase the reach of exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety.",Cognitive and behavioral practice,Matthew M.

Article,Predictors of Utilization of a Novel Smoking Cessation Smartphone App,"Background: Understanding the characteristics of high and low utilizers of smartphone applications (apps) for smoking cessation would inform development of more engaging and effective apps, yet no studies to date have addressed this critical question. Informed by prior research on predictors of cessation Web site utilization, this study examines the degree to which baseline demographic factors (gender, age, and education), smoking-related factors (smoking level and friends' smoking), and psychological factors (depression and anxiety) are predictive of utilization of a smartphone app for smoking cessation called SmartQuit. Materials and Methods: Data came from 98 participants randomized to SmartQuit as part of a pilot trial from March to May 2013. We used negative binomial count regressions to examine the relationship between user characteristics and utilization of the app over an 8-week treatment period. Results: Lower education (risk ratio [RR]=0.492; p=0.021), heavier smoking (RR=0.613; p=0.033), and depression (RR=0.958; p=0.017) prospectively predicted lower app utilization. Women (RR=0.320; p=0.022), those with lower education (RR=0.491; p=0.013), and heavier smokers (RR=0.418; p=0.039) had lower utilization of app features known to predict smoking cessation. Conclusions: Many of the predictors of utilization of smoking cessation apps are the same as those of cessation Web sites. App-delivered smoking cessation treatment effectiveness could be enhanced by focusing on increasing engagement of women, those with lower education, heavy smokers, and those with current depressive symptoms.

Article,"Pre-post, mixed-methods feasibility study of the WorkingWell mobile support tool for individuals with serious mental illness in the USA: a pilot study protocol.","INTRODUCTION: Successful competitive employment has been found to be related to enhanced self-esteem, higher quality of life and reduced mental health service use for individuals living with serious mental illnesses (SMIs) including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. The effectiveness of the individual placement and support model has been demonstrated in multiple randomised controlled trials in many countries. The management of stress, depression and anxiety in the workplace may be effectively enhanced through digital mental health interventions. The WorkingWell mobile support tool ('app') is specifically designed to meet the need for illness management support for individuals with SMI in the workplace, as an adjunct to professional treatment.; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The WorkingWell app, grounded in evidence-based supported employment, is informed by user experience design. It will be tested in a pre-post design, mixed-methods pilot study to explore issues of feasibility, acceptability and usefulness, and to provide preliminary data on the impact of use. Putative mediators of improved job tenure and psychological well-being, including postintervention changes in social support, self-efficacy and work-related motivation, will be investigated. Forty individuals at least 18 years of age, meeting the eligibility requirements for supported employment services (ie, diagnosed with a mental illness meeting the criteria for severity, duration and treatment), working a minimum of 10hours per week at study enrolment, and speaking, reading and writing in English will be recruited for the pilot study. Research staff will recruit individuals at community-based mental health agencies; provide orientation to the study, the study smartphones and the WorkingWell app; conduct research interviews including standardised measures as well as semistructured items; and provide technical assistance in telephone calls and inperson meetings. A sample of 10 agency staff will be recruited to obtain further information on the feasibility, acceptability and usefulness of WorkingWell.; ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study design and procedures are approved by the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health Central Office Research Review Committee and the Vermont Agency of Human Services Institutional Review Board. Study findings will be disseminated to agency partners, state agencies and funders, and to the research and technology development communities. Findings from the study will inform the design, data collection procedures and protocol for future full-scale randomised controlled trial testing of the effectiveness of the WorkingWell app, as well as investigations of work-related variables as mediators of psychological well-being and quality of life for individuals with SMI.

Article,"Psychoeducation in bipolar disorder with a SIMPLe smartphone application: Feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction","Background During the last fifteen years, the possibility of delivering psychoeducation programs through Internet-based platforms have been explored. Studies evaluating those programs have shown good to acceptable retention rates. In this context, we developed a smartphone application (SIMPLe) collecting information about mood symptoms and offering personalized psychoeducation messages. The main aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction of the smartphone application. Methods The study was conducted from March to August 2015. Participation in the study was proposed to a consecutive sample of adult patients attending an outpatient mental health clinic. Sociodemographic data, clinical and functional assessments alongside smartphone ownership and uses were collected at baseline and at 3 months' follow-up. A 5 item Likert-scale satisfaction questionnaire was also employed. Results 51 participants were initially enrolled in the study, 36 (74\%) remained actively using the application after 3 months. The whole sample interacted with the application a mean of 77 days (SD=26.2). During these days they completed 88\% of the daily tests. Over 86\% of the participants agreed that the experience using the application was satisfactory. Limitations The diversity of smartphones operating systems led to a moderate, although representative, sample number. Additionally, the subjective data reporting, narrow time frame of use and stability of the patients could have affected the results. Conclusions The results confirm that this particular intervention is feasible and represent a satisfactory and acceptable instrument for the self-management of bipolar disorder as an add-on to the usual treatment but future clinical trials must still probe its efficacy. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Article,"Randomized Controlled Trial of SuperBetter, a Smartphone-Based/Internet-Based Self-Help Tool to Reduce Depressive Symptoms","Objective: Technological advances have sparked the development of computer- and smartphone-based self-help programs for depressed people, but these programs' efficacy is uncertain. This randomized controlled trial evaluated an intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or the SB Web site. Materials and Methods: Online, we recruited 283 adult iPhoneÂ® (Apple, Cupertino, CA) users with significant depression symptoms according to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D). They were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) a version of SB using cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychotherapy strategies to target depression (CBT-PPT SB); (b) a general SB version focused on self-esteem and acceptance (General SB); or (c) a waiting list control group (WL). The two SB groups were instructed to use SB for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All participants completed psychological distress and well-being measures online every 2 weeks through follow-up. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using hierarchical linear modeling. Results: As hypothesized, SB participants achieved greater reductions in CES-D scores than WL participants by posttest (Cohen's d=0.67) and by follow-up (d=1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform better than General SB; both versions of SB were more effective than the WL control. Differences between SB versions favored General SB but were not statistically significant. Conclusions: These large effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light of high attrition rates and the motivated, self-selected sample. Nonetheless, smartphone-based/Internet-based self-help may play an important role in treating depression. Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",Games for Health Journal,A.M. Roepke and S.R.

Article,"Rationale, design and pilot feasibility results of a smartphone-assisted, mindfulness-based intervention for smokers with mood disorders: Project mSMART MIND","Background: Although individuals with psychiatric disorders are disproportionately affected by cigarette smoking, few outpatient mental health treatment facilities offer smoking cessation services. In this paper, we describe the development of a smartphone-assisted mindfulness smoking cessation intervention with contingency management (SMI-CM), as well as the design and methods of an ongoing pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. We also report the results of an open-label pilot feasibility study. Methods: In phase 1, we developed and pilot-tested SMI-CM, which includes a smartphone intervention app that prompts participants to practice mindfulness, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports 5 times per day, and submit carbon monoxide (CO) videos twice per day. Participants earned incentives if submitted videos showed CO â‰¤ 6 ppm. In phase 2, smokers receiving outpatient treatment for mood disorders are randomized to receive SMI-CM or enhanced standard treatment plus non-contingent CM (EST). Results: The results from the pilot feasibility study (N = 8) showed that participants practiced mindfulness an average of 3.4 times/day (â‰¥ 3 min), completed 72.3\% of prompted EMA reports, and submitted 68.0\% of requested CO videos. Participants reported that the program was helpful overall (M = 4.85/5) and that daily mindfulness practice was helpful for both managing mood and quitting smoking (Ms = 4.50/5). Conclusions: The results from the feasibility study indicated high levels of acceptability and satisfaction with SMI-CM. The ongoing RCT will allow evaluation of the efficacy and mechanisms of action underlying SMI-CM for improving cessation rates among smokers with mood disorders. 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Contemporary Clinical Trials,H.

Article,"Reducing depressive symptomatology with a smartphone app: Study protocol for a randomized, placebo-controlled trial","Background: Depression has become one of the leading contributors to the global disease burden. Evidence-based treatments for depression are available, but access to them is still limited in some instances. As technology has become more integrated into mental health care, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols have become available and have been recently transposed to mobile environments (e.g., smartphones) in the form of {""}apps.{""} Preliminary research on some depression apps has shown promising results in reducing subthreshold or mild to moderate depressive symptoms. However, this small number of studies reports a low statistical power and they have not yet been replicated. Moreover, none of them included an active placebo comparison group. This is problematic, as a {""}digital placebo effect{""} may explain some of the positive effects documented until now. The aim of this study is to test a newly developed mobile app firmly grounded in the CBT theory of depression to determine whether this app is clinically useful in decreasing moderate depressive symptoms when compared with an active placebo. Additionally, we are interested in the app's effect on emotional wellbeing and depressogenic cognitions. Methods/design: Romanian-speaking adults (18 years and older) with access to a computer and the Internet and owning a smartphone are included in the study. A randomized, three-arm clinical trial is being conducted (i.e., active intervention, placebo intervention and delayed intervention). Two hundred and twenty participants with moderate depressive symptoms (i.e., obtaining scores {\textbackslash}textgreater9 and â‰¤16 on the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) will be randomized to the three conditions. Participants undergoing therapy, presenting serious mental health problems, or legal or health issues that would prevent them from using the app, as well as participants reporting suicidal ideation are excluded. Participants randomized to the active and placebo interventions will use the smartphone app for 6 weeks. A short therapist check-in via phone will take place every week. Participants in the delayed-intervention condition will be given access to the app after 6 weeks from randomization. The primary outcome is the level of depressive symptomatology. The intervention delivered through the app to the active condition includes psychoeducational materials and exercises based on CBT for depression, while the placebo intervention uses a sham version of the app (i.e., similar structure of courses and exercises). Discussion: To our knowledge, this study protocol is the first to test the efficacy of a smartphone app for depressive symptomatology in the form of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that includes an active placebo condition. As such, this can substantially add to the body of evidence supporting the use of apps designed to decrease depression. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03060200.

Article,"Safety, Acceptability, and Use of a Smartphone App, BlueIce, for Young People Who Self-Harm: Protocol for an Open Phase I Trial","Background: Up to 18\% of adolescents will engage in an act of self-harm before young adulthood, with the majority of acts occurring in private. Mobile apps may offer a way of providing support for young people at times of distress to prevent self-harm. Objective: This is a proof-of-concept study designed to explore the safety, acceptability, feasibility, and usability of a smartphone app, BlueIce, with young people who are self-harming. Methods: In this phase I open trial we will evaluate BlueIce, a smartphone app developed and coproduced with young people with lived experience of self-harm. BlueIce includes a mood-monitoring diary, selection of mood-lifting techniques based on cognitive behavior therapy and dialectical behavior therapy, and direct access to emergency telephone numbers. We will recruit young people (n=50) attending specialist child and adolescent mental health services with a current or past history of self-harm to trial BlueIce as an adjunct to their usual care. Questionnaires and interviews will be completed at baseline, postfamiliarization (2 weeks), and at follow-up (12 weeks after baseline) to assess safety, app use, and acceptability. Interviews will be undertaken with clinicians to assess the feasibility of BlueIce within a clinical setting. Results: Recruitment occurred between May and November 2016. The recruitment target was 50, and by the beginning of November 54 young people had been referred. Conclusions: This study is the first to evaluate an app specifically developed with young people for young people (under the age of 18 years) who self-harm. It will determine whether BlueIce is acceptable, how often it is used, and whether it is safe and does not have any unintentional adverse effects. This information will determine whether a feasibility trial to test recruitment, randomization, retention, and appropriate outcome measures should be pursued.",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,Paul Stallard and Joanna Porter and Rebecca Grist,2016,"adolescents, CBT, smartphone app, BlueIce, DBT, self-harm","245 - Safety, Acceptability, and Use",245,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,Blue Ice,United Kingdom,25-Suicidal behavior disorder/nonsuicidal self-injury,25,Suicidal behavior disorder/nonsuicidal self-injury,NA,Self-harm,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,PROTOCOL FOR AN OPEN PHASE I TRIAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO,NO ASSESSMENT,NO,United Kingdom
InProceedings,Self-monitoring and psychoeducation in bipolar patients with a smart-phone application (SIMPLe) project: Preliminary results from a feasibility study,"INTRODUCTION: The SIMPLe project was designed with the objective of developing a smartphone application, which could monitor and psychoeducate bipolar disorder patients through highly personalized messages based on both passive and active information. A secondary long-Term objective of the SIMPLe project is to integrate biomedical information with the mobile behavior information collected in order to determine predictive relapses patterns. METHODS: The phases of the SIMPLe project involved an iterative process with the active participation of both patients and mental health professionals. The feasibility study phase of the project analyzed variables from the recruitment phase and server requests from the users' application. RESULTS: The participation in the feasibility study was offered to 70 stable bipolar patients.43 subjects were enrolled in the study. The main reasons for those who did not take part of the study was not having a compatible device(59\%). 95\% of the initial participants remain actively using the application during the 3 months considered during which no relapses were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The results so far suggest a high acceptance from the patients enrolled in the study. However, due to the fragmentation of the smartphone market, there is a risk that this sample would not represents the whole population of bipolar patients. DISCUSSION: Mobile technologies seems a feasible option, which could bring a novel type of data to the mental health field. Even though, there are still challenges ahead in order to harness its full potential. Copyright 2015 ICST.",NA,D. Hidalgo-Mazzei and E. Vieta and F.

Article,"SlowMo, a digital therapy targeting reasoning in paranoia, versus treatment as usual in the treatment of people who fear harm from others: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","Background: Paranoia is one of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and is associated with significant distress and disruption to the person's life. Developing more effective and accessible psychological interventions for paranoia is a clinical priority. Our research team has approached this challenge in two main ways: firstly, by adopting an interventionist causal approach to increase effectiveness and secondly, by incorporating user-centred inclusive design methods to enhance accessibility and usability. Our resultant new digital intervention, SlowMo, intensively targets a reasoning style associated with paranoia, fast thinking, characterised by jumping to conclusions and belief inflexibility. It consists of an easy-to-use, enjoyable and memorable digital interface. An interactive web-based app facilitates delivery of face-to-face meetings which is then synchronised with an innovative mobile app for use in daily life. Methods/Design: We aim to test the clinical efficacy of SlowMo over 24 weeks to determine the mechanisms through which it reduces paranoia, and to identify participant characteristics that moderate its effectiveness. In a parallel-group randomised controlled trial, with 1:1 allocation, 360 participants with distressing persecutory beliefs will be independently randomised to receive either the SlowMo intervention added to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU, using randomly varying permuted blocks, stratified by paranoia severity and site. Research workers will be blind to therapy allocation. The primary outcome is paranoia severity over 24 weeks; our hypothesised mechanism of change is reasoning; moderators include negative symptoms and working memory; and secondary outcomes include wellbeing, quality of life, and service use. The accessibility, usability and acceptability of the digital platform will be assessed. Discussion: SlowMo has been developed as the first blended digital therapy to target fears of harm from others through an inclusive design approach. In addition to testing its efficacy, this trial will add to our understanding of psychological mechanisms in paranoia. The study will examine the usability and adherence of a novel digital therapy, including an app for self-management, in a large sample of people affected by severe mental health difficulties.

Article,Smartphone based Geo-Feedback in obsessive compulsive disorder as facilitatory intervention: A case report,"Checking behavior belongs to one of the core-cluster symptoms in patients suffering from OCD. These symptoms often hinder patients to participate in social interaction or to get to their therapist in time. A global-positioning-system (GPS) based smartphone application was developed to provide audio-feedback signals to the patient if too much time was needed to cover a predefined distance.The application (app) was tested in a patient suffering from severe OCD with extensive outdoor checking behavior. Using the app, the patient managed to reach the therapist in time allowing him to initiate treatment with exposure and reaction prevention and a SSRI.This is the first report of a smartphone based application using GPS signals to give feedback to an OCD-patient.

Article,Smartphone cognitive behavioral therapy as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for refractory depression: Randomized controlled trial,"Background: In the treatment of major depression, antidepressants are effective but not curative. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also effective, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, but accessibility is a problem. Objective: The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT app as adjunctive therapy among patients with antidepressant-resistant major depression. Methods: A multisite, assessor-masked, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in 20 psychiatric clinics and hospitals in Japan. Participants were eligible if they had a primary diagnosis of major depression and were antidepressant-refractory after taking one or more antidepressants at an adequate dosage for four or more weeks. After a 1-week run-in in which participants started the medication switch and had access to the welcome session of the app, patients were randomized to medication switch alone or to medication switch plus smartphone CBT app via the centralized Web system. The smartphone app, called Kokoro-app ({""}kokoro{""} means {""}mind{""} in Japanese), included sessions on self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring presented by cartoon characters. The primary outcome was depression severity as assessed by masked telephone assessors with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at week 9. The secondary outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings (FIBSER). Results: In the total sample (N=164), 81 participants were allocated to the smartphone CBT in addition to medication change and 83 to medication change alone. In the former group, all but one participant (80/81, 99\%) completed at least half, and 71 (88\%) completed at least six of eight sessions. In the intention-to-treat analysis, patients allocated the CBT app scored 2.48 points (95\% CI 1.23-3.72, P{\textbackslash}textless.001; standardized mean difference 0.40) lower on PHQ-9 than the control at week 9. The former group also scored 4.1 points (95\% CI 1.5-6.6, P=.002) lower on BDI-II and 0.76 points (95\% CI -0.05 to 1.58, P=.07) lower on FIBSER. In the per-protocol sample (comfortable with the smartphone app, still symptomatic, and adherent to medication with mild or less side effects after run-in), the intervention group (n=60) scored 1.72 points (95\% CI 0.25-3.18, P=.02) lower on PHQ-9, 3.2 points (95\% CI -0.01 to 6.3, P=.05) lower on BDI-II, and 0.75 points (95\% CI 0.03-1.47, P=.04) lower on FIBSER than the control (n=57). The treatment benefits were maintained up to week 17. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT in the treatment of clinically diagnosed depression. Given the merits of the mobile mental health intervention, including accessibility, affordability, quality control, and effectiveness, it is clinically worthwhile to consider adjunctive use of a smartphone CBT app when treating patients with antidepressant-resistant depression.

Article,Smartphone-Enhanced Low-Threshold Intervention for adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa (SELTIAN) waiting for outpatient psychotherapy: Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial,"Introduction As smartphones are widely distributed nowadays, mental health apps seem to be a promising treatment tool. First self-help apps for eating disorders have been developed recently. However, studies assessing the efficacy of such apps are scarce. A smartphone app could prevent further weight reduction and increase commitment during waiting time for outpatient treatment, especially for adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). In this study protocol, a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a smartphone-enhanced low-threshold intervention for AN during waiting time is described. Methods and analysis 30 adolescents with AN aged 12-19 years will be recruited at three child and adolescent psychiatry centres in Germany. All participants will be randomised to consultations only or consultations and the use of the Jourvie Research app. The app will be installed either on their own smartphone or on a research device. The participants will receive biweekly to monthly consultations for 3 months to review meal plans and weight management with a clinician. In addition, the Jourvie Research app for meal, behaviour and emotion protocolling will be provided to the intervention group. The protocols will be discussed with a clinician during the consultations. Dialectical behaviour therapy-informed skills for tension regulation to increase compliance with the meal plan will be taught in the intervention group and the app will remind the participant of a skill in a moment of need. The primary outcome is the age-adjusted and height-adjusted weight gain in standard deviation score after 3 months. Ethics and dissemination Results will be disseminated at conferences and through peer-reviewed publications. The trial was approved by the ethics review board of the local medical association, Mainz, Germany, under the reference number 837.338.15.

Article,Smartphone-supported versus full behavioural activation for depression: A randomised controlled trial,"Background There is need for more cost and time effective treatments for depression. This is the first randomised controlled trial in which a blended treatment - including four face-to-face sessions and a smartphone application - was compared against a full behavioural treatment. Hence, the aim of the current paper was to examine whether a blended smartphone treatment was non-inferior to a full behavioural activation treatment for depression. Methods This was a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial (NCT01819025) comparing a blended treatment (n=46) against a full ten-session treatment (n=47) for people suffering from major depression. Primary outcome measure was the BDI-II, that was administered at pre- and post-treatment, as well as six months after the treatment. Results Results showed significant improvements in both groups across time on the primary outcome measure (within-group Cohen's d=1.35; CI [-0.82, 3.52] to d=1.47; CI [-0.41, 3.35]; between group d=-0.13 CI [-2.37, 2.09] and d=-0.10 CI [-2.53, 2.33]). At the same time, the blended treatment reduced the therapist time with an average of 47\%. Conclusions We could not establish whether the blended treatment was non-inferior to a full BA treatment. Nevertheless, this study points to that the blended treatment approach could possibly treat nearly twice as many patients suffering from depression by using a smartphone applicaÂ¬tion as add-on. More studies are needed before we can suggest that the blended treatment method is a promising cost-effective alternative to regular face-to-face treatment for depression. 2015 Ly et al.

Article,TechCare: mobile assessment and therapy for psychosis - an intervention for clients in the Early Intervention Service: A feasibility study protocol.,"OBJECTIVES: Technological advances in healthcare have shown promise when delivering interventions for mental health problems such as psychosis. The aim of this project is to develop a mobile phone intervention for people with psychosis and to conduct a feasibility study of the TechCare App.; METHODS: The TechCare App will assess participant's symptoms and respond with a personalised guided self-help-based psychological intervention with the aim of exploring feasibility and acceptability. The project will recruit 16 service users and 8-10 health professionals from the Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust Early Intervention Service.; RESULTS: In strand 1 of the study, we will invite people to discuss their experience of psychosis and give their opinions on the existing evidence-based treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy) and how the mobile app can be developed. In strand 2, we will complete a test run with a small number of participants (n=4) to refine the mobile intervention (TechCare). Finally, in strand 3 of the study, the TechCare App will be examined in a feasibility study with 12 participants.; CONCLUSION: It has been suggested that there is a need for a rapid increase in the efforts to develop the evidence base for the clinical effectiveness of digital technologies, considering mHealth research can potentially be helpful in addressing the demand on mental health services globally.",SAGE open medicine,Nusrat Husain and Nadeem Gire and James Kelly and Joy Duxbury and Mick McKeown and Miv Riley and Christopher Dj Taylor and Peter J.

Article,The effectiveness of a suicide prevention app for indigenous Australian youths: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Indigenous Australian youth (aged 15 to 34) have up to four times the risk of suicide compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts. Barriers to help-seeking include shame, feared loss of autonomy and negative attitudes towards healthcare providers. The use of mobile devices and apps continues to rise amongst young people, thus presenting opportunities to utilize these aids in overcoming help-seeking barriers. Apps have been shown to assist in several health-related areas, including weight loss and smoking cessation, although no apps have as yet been evaluated for suicide prevention. Moreover, there is a lack of research that scientifically evaluates suicide prevention interventions within Indigenous communities.Methods/Design: In this study, a recently developed self-help app will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention is based on acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy. It is aimed at participants who have suicidal thoughts but who are not actively suicidal. In total, 150 participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 75) or to the wait-list control condition (N = 75). Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, post-test and 6 weeks follow-up. The primary outcome measure is a reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of depression, anxiety and impulsivity.Discussion: This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-help app for suicidal thoughts amongst young Indigenous people. Several limitations and strengths of the design are discussed.Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12613000104752. 2013 Shand et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Trials,F.L.

Article,"The feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes of PRIME-D: A novel mobile intervention treatment for depression","Background: Despite decades of research and development, depression has risen from the fifth to the leading cause of disability in the United States. Barriers to progress in the field are (1) poor access to high-quality care; (2) limited mental health workforce; and (3) few providers trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments (EBTs). Although mobile platforms are being developed to give consumers greater access to high-quality care, too often these tools do not have empirical support for their effectiveness. In this study, we evaluated PRIME-D, a mobile app intervention that uses social networking, goal setting, and a mental health coach to deliver text-based, EBT's to treat mood symptoms and functioning in adults with depression. Methods: Thirty-six adults with depression remotely participated in PRIME-D over an 8-week period with a 4-week follow-up, with 83\% retained over the 12-week course of thestudy. Results: On average, participants logged into the app 5 days/week. Depression scores (PHQ-9) significantly improved over time (over 50\% reduction), with coach interactions enhancing these effects. Mood-related disability (Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)) also significantly decreased over time with participants no longer being impaired by their mood symptoms. Overall use of PRIME-D predicted greater gains in functioning. Improvements in mood and functioning were sustained over the 4-week follow-up. Conclusions: Results suggest that PRIME-D is a feasible, acceptable, and effective intervention for adults with depression and that a mobile service delivery model may address the serious public health problem of poor access to high-quality mental health care. 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Depression and Anxiety,D.A.

Article,The SmartCAT: An m- Health Platform for Ecological Momentary Intervention in Child Anxiety Treatment,"Introduction:Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety, although efficacious, typically requires 16-20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Brief CBT (BCBT; eight sessions) for child anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential to improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage youth in learning and practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo).Materials and Methods:We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cues youth to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to engage youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot study with nine youth (9-14 years old) examined the platform's feasibility as an adjunct to BCBT.Results:SmartCAT was found to be capable of supporting BCBT for child anxiety and received positive feedback from both therapists and youth patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1-7 scale, with 1=easy). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14min (standard deviation=0.98min) to complete the entries.Conclusions:A smartphone app is feasible within CBT for child anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use.

Article,"Therapist-Assisted, Online (TAO) intervention for anxiety in college students: TAO outperformed treatment as usual","How can time spent conducting individual psychotherapy go farther? How can psychotherapy make effective use of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers? Traditional hour-long, face-toface therapy is effective, but it cannot meet the demand in many mental health sectors and fails to capitalize on emergent communication tools. There is a need for new treatments that are effective but more efficient. Individual treatment that uses online components to reduce, not eliminate, direct contact with the psychotherapist was first used and proven effective in several other countries. It now is being implemented and researched in the United States. This article details the structure, content, and effectiveness of Therapist Assisted Online (TAO) psychotherapy, a 7-week individual treatment for anxiety that uses online tools to keep client engagement and therapeutic intensity high, with a fraction of the therapist time of conventional therapy. TAO treatment pairs online educational materials with brief therapist contact through phone, chat, or video conferencing. This treatment combines 4 tools associated with improved outcomes: text-message reminders, homework on mobile devices, video conference sessions, and weekly progress measures completed by and reviewed with the client. In research conducted at a large university counseling center, TAO clients had greater reductions in anxiety and greater improvement in global mental health, life functioning, and their sense of well-being than treatment-as-usual clients. Although not all anxiety clients are suitable candidates, TAO can treat many clients for whom treatment as usual is not ideal or practical, without fear that client welfare or therapy effectiveness are affected. 2016 American Psychological Association.",Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,S.A.

Article,Therapy on the move: The development of a therapeutic smartphone application,"The present research investigated the use of a Smartphone App as an adjunct in the treatment of a range of anxiety disorders. The primary aim of the App was to increase client adherence to between session therapy tasks, involving homework practice of a range of skills and tasks known to be associated with successful treatment of anxiety disorders. Homework is an important component of many therapeutic approaches, allowing clients to practise therapeutic skills between sessions, as well as providing continuity between sessions (Freeman \& Rosenfield, 2002). Greater client adherence to homework tasks has been associated with improved treatment outcomes, and may be particularly important for reducing the risk of relapse (Scheel, Hanson, \& Razzhavaikina, 2004). However, despite the benefits of engagement with homework tasks, client adherence to these activities can often be a significant barrier to treatment (Addis \& Jacobson, 2000; Burns \& Nolenhoeksema, 1991; Detweiler \& Whisman, 1999; Detweiler-Bedell \& Whisman, 2005). It is also one area in which the use of adjunctive technologies may have the greatest impact. The aim of this paper was to describe the development and pilot testing of a therapeutic Smartphone application, namely, PsychAssist. This application was designed as an adjunct to face-to-face therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders among adults. The App was developed with the purpose of enhancing client engagement and adherence to between session (homework) tasks to improve maintenance and generalization of therapeutic behaviours.

This therapeutic application is basically an interactive 'Bedwetting Calendar', based on traditional cognitive behavioural modification therapies and positive reinforcement systems. Enuresis is defined as the failure of voluntary control of the urethral sphincter. The prevalence of enuresis is 15-20\% in the child population; however, children with ADHD had a 2.7 times higher incidence of nocturnal enuresis.

Article,Two Novel Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Mobile Apps for Agoraphobia: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Despite the large body of literature demonstrating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral treatments for agoraphobia, many patients remain untreated because of various barriers to treatment. Web-based and mobile-based interventions targeting agoraphobia may provide a solution to this problem, but there is a lack of research investigating the efficacy of such interventions. Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate for the first time the effectiveness of a self-guided mobile-based intervention primarily targeting agoraphobic symptoms, with respect to a generic mobile app targeting anxiety. Methods: A Web-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared a novel mobile app designed to target agoraphobia (called Agoraphobia Free) with a mobile app designed to help with symptoms of anxiety in general (called Stress Free). Both interventions were based on established cognitive behavioral principles. We recruited participants (N = 170) who self-identified as having agoraphobia and assessed them online at baseline, midpoint, and end point (posttreatment) over a period of 12 weeks. The primary outcome was symptom severity measured by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale. Results: Both groups had statistically significant improvements in symptom severity over time (difference -5.97, 95\% CI -8.49 to -3.44, P {\textbackslash}textless.001 for Agoraphobia Free and -6.35, 95\% CI -8.82 to -3.87, P {\textbackslash}textless.001 for Stress Free), but there were no significant between-group differences on the primary outcome (difference 0.38, 95\% CI -1.96 to 3.20, P = .64). Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT to provide evidence that people who identify as having agoraphobia may equally benefit from a diagnosis-specific and a transdiagnostic mobile-based intervention.

Article,Usability of a Culturally Informed mHealth Intervention for Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Feedback From Young Sexual Minority Men.,"BACKGROUND: To date, we are aware of no interventions for anxiety and depression developed as mobile phone apps and tailored to young sexual minority men, a group especially at risk of anxiety and depression. We developed TODAY!, a culturally informed mobile phone intervention for young men who are attracted to men and who have clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression. The core of the intervention consists of daily psychoeducation informed by transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a set of tools to facilitate putting these concepts into action, with regular mood ratings that result in tailored feedback (eg, tips for current distress and visualizations of mood by context).; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct usability testing to understand how young sexual minority men interact with the app, to inform later stages of intervention development.; METHODS: Participants (n=9) were young sexual minority men aged 18-20 years (Mean=19.00, standard deviation [SD]=0.71; 44\% black, 44\% white, and 11.1\% Latino), who endorsed at least mild depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants were recruited via flyers, emails to college lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations, Web-based advertisements, another researcher's database of sexual minority youth interested in research participation, and word of mouth. During recorded interviews, participants were asked to think out loud while interacting with the TODAY! app on a mobile phone or with paper prototypes. Feedback identified from these recordings and from associated field notes were subjected to thematic analysis using a general inductive approach. To aid interpretation of results, methods and results are reported according to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ).; RESULTS: Thematic analysis of usability feedback revealed a theme of general positive feedback, as well as six recurring themes that informed continued development: (1) functionality (eg, highlight new material when available), (2) personalization (eg, more tailored feedback), (3) presentation (eg, keep content brief), (4) aesthetics (eg, use brighter colors), (5) LGBT or youth content (eg, add content about coming out), and (6) barriers to use (eg, perceiving psychoeducation as homework).; CONCLUSIONS: Feedback from usability testing was vital to understanding what young sexual minority men desire from a mobile phone intervention for symptoms of anxiety and depression and was used to inform the ongoing development of such an intervention.",JMIR human factors,John B.

Article,Use of a Smartphone Recovery Tool for Latinos with Co-Occurring Alcohol and Other Drug Disorders and Mental Disorders,"Objective: Addressing alcohol and other drug disorders and other mental disorders among adult Hispanics/Latinos is of critical concern, as they are one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups with a disproportionate rate of disease, mental disorders, and poverty. Although improvement in outcomes is associated with sustained participation in ongoing treatment for co-occurring alcohol and other drug disorders/mental disorders, continuing care is rare for these chronic conditions, especially for Latinos with more limited access to culturally and linguistically competent services. Methods: The evidence-based smartphone recovery application Addictionâ€“Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) was translated and adapted for Spanish-speaking Latinos with alcohol and other drug disorders/mental disorders, thus developing CASA-CHESS to address a high level of need for services, high rates of relapse, and lack of existing culturally competent services for Latinos. Results: Of the 79 Latino clients who completed residential treatment and received a smartphone equipped with CASA-CHESS, 26.6\% discontinued using CASA-CHESS and 73.4\% remained active for four or more months. CASA-CHESS usage was sustained over the four months across all three tenets of self-determination theory (competence, relatedness, and autonomy), with the most commonly utilized services being relevant to relatedness (e.g., messaging, discussion boards). CASA-CHESS clients demonstrated a similar pattern of usage to A-CHESS clients. Conclusions: Findings illustrate that Spanish-speaking Latinos with alcohol and other drug disorders/mental disorders will use a smartphone application to assist with their recovery, continuing their access to resources, case management, and quality information after leaving residential treatment. Consistent with previous findings, our results also emphasize the importance of social support during the four months post-discharge. Such evidence-based, theory-driven digital interventions may extend access to culturally and linguistically competent services. 2017 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.",Journal of Dual Diagnosis,J.

Article,"User-centered design of learn to quit, a smoking cessation smartphone app for people with serious mental illness","Background: Smoking rates in the United States have been reduced in the past decades to 15\% of the general population. However, up to 88\% of people with psychiatric symptoms still smoke, leading to high rates of disease and mortality. Therefore, there is a great need to develop smoking cessation interventions that have adequate levels of usability and can reach this population. Objective: The objective of this study was to report the rationale, ideation, design, user research, and final specifications of a novel smoking cessation app for people with serious mental illness (SMI) that will be tested in a feasibility trial. Methods: We used a variety of user-centered design methods and materials to develop the tailored smoking cessation app. This included expert panel guidance, a set of design principles and theory-based smoking cessation content, development of personas and paper prototyping, usability testing of the app prototype, establishment of app's core vision and design specification, and collaboration with a software development company. Results: We developed Learn to Quit, a smoking cessation app designed and tailored to individuals with SMI that incorporates the following: (1) evidence-based smoking cessation content from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and US Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation aimed at providing skills for quitting while addressing mental health symptoms, (2) a set of behavioral principles to increase retention and comprehension of smoking cessation content, (3) a gamification component to encourage and sustain app engagement during a 14-day period, (4) an app structure and layout designed to minimize usability errors in people with SMI, and (5) a set of stories and visuals that communicate smoking cessation concepts and skills in simple terms. Conclusions: Despite its increasing importance, the design and development of mHealth technology is typically underreported, hampering scientific innovation. This report describes the systematic development of the first smoking cessation app tailored to people with SMI, a population with very high rates of nicotine addiction, and offers new design strategies to engage this population. mHealth developers in smoking cessation and related fields could benefit from a design strategy that capitalizes on the role visual engagement, storytelling, and the systematic application of behavior analytic principles to deliver evidence-based content.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,R.

Article,Using a mobile application in the treatment of dysregulated anger among veterans,"Objective: Anger is a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with a range of clinical and functional impairments, and may be especially prevalent among veterans with PTSD. Effective anger management therapies exist but may be undermined by poor engagement or lack of treatment availability. Finding ways to engage veterans in anger management therapy or to improve access can be helpful in improving clinical outcomes. This randomized controlled trial compared anger management treatment (AMT) with AMT augmented by a mobile application (app) system, Remote Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management (RELAX). Methods: Participants were 58 veterans enrolled in 12 sessions of either AMT alone or AMT with the RELAX system (AMT + RELAX). The RELAX system includes the RELAX app, a wearable heart rate monitor, a remote server, and a webbased therapist interface. RELAX allows the user to practice skills, monitor symptoms, and record physiological data. The server collects data on app use. A web-based interface allows the therapist to access data on between-session practice, and skills use. Measures administered at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-and 6-month follow-up include state and trait anger, dimensions of anger, PTSD, depression, interpersonal functioning, and satisfaction. We used multilevel modeling to account for the nesting of time points within participants and participants within treatment groups. Predictors were Treatment Condition (AMT + RELAX and AMT), Linear Time (baseline, post-treatment, 3-and 6-month follow-up), and Quadratic Time and Treatment Condition Ã— Linear Time interaction. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (Armonk, New York). Approval was obtained from the institutional review board. Results: Across groups, the treatment dropout rate was 13.8\%; of those who remained in treatment, 90\% received an adequate dose of treatment (10 or more sessions). There were no significant differences between groups on attendance or treatment completion. Participants in both treatments demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in anger severity and significant post-treatment reductions in PTSD. Veterans did not report significant changes in depression or interpersonal functioning. Veterans in the AMT + RELAX group reported spending significantly less time on homework assignments, and they rated the AMT + RELAX app as helpful and easy to use, with these ratings improving over time. Conclusion: Findings suggest that AMT + RELAX was beneficial in reducing anger symptoms and promoting efficient use of the between-session practice; however, AMT + RELAX did not outperform AMT. This study is an important contribution as it is one of the first randomized controlled trials to study the efficacy of a technologyenhanced, evidence-based psychotherapy for anger management. Findings are limited because of small sample size and modifications to the technology during the trial. However, the results highlight the possible benefits of mobile appâ€“supported treatment, including increasing the accessibility of treatment, lowering therapist workload, reducing costs of treatment, reducing practice time, and enabling new activities and types of treatments. This study presents preliminary evidence that mobile apps can be a valuable addition to treatment for patients with anger difficulties. Future research should evaluate how much therapist involvement is needed to support anger management. Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.",Military Medicine,M.-A.

Article,Using a smartphone app to reduce cognitive vulnerability and mild depressive symptoms: Study protocol of an exploratory randomized controlled trial,"Background: Depression is a major challenge worldwide, with significant increasing personal, economic, and societal costs. Although empirically supported treatments have been developed, they are not always available for patients in routine clinical care. Therefore, we need effective and widely accessible strategies to prevent the onset of the very first depressive symptoms. Mental health apps could prove a valuable solution for this desideratum. Although preliminary research has indicated that such apps can be useful in treating depression, no study has attempted to test their utility in preventing depressive symptoms. The aim of this exploratory study is to contrast the efficacy of a smartphone app in reducing cognitive vulnerability and mild depressive symptoms, as risk factors for the onset of depression, against a wait-list condition. More specifically, we aim to test an app designed to (1) decrease general cognitive vulnerability and (2) promote engagement in protective, adaptive activities, while (3) counteracting (through gamification and customization) the tendency of premature dropout from intervention. Methods/design: Romanian-speaking adults (18years and older) with access to a computer and the Internet and who own a smartphone are included in the study. Two parallel randomized clinical trials are conducted: in the first one, 50 participants free of depressive symptoms (i.e., who obtain scores â‰¤4 on the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) will be included, while in the second one 50 participants with minimal depressive symptoms (i.e., who obtain PHQ-9 scores between 5 and 9) will be included. Participants undergoing therapy, presenting with substance abuse problems, psychotic symptoms, and organic brain disorders, or serious legal or health issues that would prevent them from using the app, as well as participants reporting suicidal ideation are excluded. Participants randomized to the active intervention will autonomously use the smartphone app for 4weeks, while the others will be given access to the app after 4weeks from randomization. The primary outcomes are (1) cognitive vulnerability factors as defined within the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) paradigm (i.e., dysfunctional cognitions, irrational beliefs, and negative automatic thoughts) (for the first trial), and (2) level of depressive symptomatology (for the second trial). The app includes self-help materials and exercises based on CBT for depression, presented in a tailored manner and incorporating gamification elements aimed at boosting motivation to use the app. Discussion: This study protocol is the first to capitalize on the ubiquity of smartphones to large-scale dissemination of CBT-based strategies aimed at preventing depression in non-clinical populations.

Article,Using mobile health technology to improve behavioral skill implementation through homework in evidence-based parenting intervention for disruptive behavior disorders in youth: study protocol for intervention development and evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) (oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD)) are prevalent, costly, and oftentimes chronic psychiatric disorders of childhood. Evidence-based interventions that focus on assisting parents to utilize effective skills to modify children's problematic behaviors are first-line interventions for the treatment of DBDs. Although efficacious, the effects of these interventions are often attenuated by poor implementation of the skills learned during treatment by parents, often referred to as between-session homework. The multiple family group (MFG) model is an evidence-based, skills-based intervention model for the treatment of DBDs in school-age youth residing in urban, socio-economically disadvantaged communities. While data suggest benefits of MFG on DBD behaviors, similar to other skill-based interventions, the effects of MFG are mitigated by the poor homework implementation, despite considerable efforts to support parents in homework implementation. This paper focuses on the study protocol for the development and preliminary evaluation of a theory-based, smartphone mobile health (mHealth) application (My MFG) to support homework implementation by parents participating in MFG.; METHODS/DESIGN: This paper describes a study design proposal that begins with a theoretical model, uses iterative design processes to develop My MFG to support homework implementation in MFG through a series of pilot studies, and a small-scale pilot randomised controlled trial to determine if the intervention can demonstrate change (preliminary efficacy) of My MFG in outpatient mental health settings in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.; DISCUSSION: This preliminary study aims to understand the implementation of mHealth methods to improve the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions in routine outpatient mental health care settings for youth with disruptive behavior and their families.

Article,Using mobile technology to deliver a cognitive behaviour therapy-informed intervention in early psychosis (Actissist): Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is recommended for the treatment of psychosis; however, only a small proportion of service users have access to this intervention. Smartphone technology using software applications (apps) could increase access to psychological approaches for psychosis. This paper reports the protocol development for a clinical trial of smartphone-based CBT. Methods/Design: We present a study protocol that describes a single-blind randomised controlled trial comparing a cognitive behaviour therapy-informed software application (Actissist) plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) with a symptom monitoring software application (ClinTouch) plus TAU in early psychosis. The study consists of a 12-week intervention period. We aim to recruit and randomly assign 36 participants registered with early intervention services (EIS) across the North West of England, UK in a 2:1 ratio to each arm of the trial. Our primary objective is to determine whether in people with early psychosis the Actissist app is feasible to deliver and acceptable to use. Secondary aims are to determine whether Actissist impacts on predictors of first episode psychosis (FEP) relapse and enhances user empowerment, functioning and quality of life. Assessments will take place at baseline, 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 22-weeks (10 weeks post-treatment) by assessors blind to treatment condition. The trial will report on the feasibility and acceptability of Actissist and compare outcomes between the randomised arms. The study also incorporates semi-structured interviews about the experience of participating in the Actissist trial that will be qualitatively analysed to inform future developments of the Actissist protocol and app. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability, uptake, attrition and potential efficacy of a CBT-informed smartphone app for early psychosis. Mobile applications designed to deliver a psychologically-informed intervention offer new possibilities to extend the reach of traditional mental health service delivery across a range of serious mental health problems and provide choice about available care.

Article,Using PTSD Coach in primary care with and without clinician support: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of two approaches to using the PTSD Coach mobile application in primary care: Self-Managed PTSD Coach and Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach. This study also aims to gather preliminary data to investigate if clinician support improves the benefits of using PTSD Coach on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity and specialty mental healthcare utilization. Method: Twenty primary care veterans with PTSD symptoms were randomized to either Self-Managed PTSD Coach consisting of one 10-min session providing instructions for application use or Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach consisting of four 20-min sessions focused on setting symptom reduction goals and helping veterans fully engage with application content. Results: Research procedures and intervention conditions appear feasible as indicated by high rates of assessment and intervention retention and high clinician fidelity and satisfaction. Both treatments resulted in reductions in PTSD symptoms, with 7 Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach and 3 Self-Managed PTSD Coach participants reporting clinically significant improvements. Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach resulted in more specialty PTSD care use postintervention and possibly greater reductions in PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Both PTSD Coach interventions are feasible and potentially helpful. The addition of clinician support appears to increase the effectiveness of self-management alone. A larger-scale randomized controlled trial is warranted to confirm these encouraging preliminary findings. 2016.",General Hospital Psychiatry,K. Possemato and E. Kuhn and E. Johnson and J.E.

Article,Using smartphones to decrease substance use via self-monitoring and recovery support: Study protocol for a randomized control trial,"Background: Alcohol abuse, other substance use disorders, and risk behaviors associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent three of the top 10 modifiable causes of mortality in the US. Despite evidence that continuing care is effective in sustaining recovery from substance use disorders and associated behaviors, patients rarely receive it. Smartphone applications (apps) have been effective in delivering continuing care to patients almost anywhere and anytime. This study tests the effectiveness of two components of such apps: ongoing self-monitoring through Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) and immediate recovery support through Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs). Methods/design: The target population, adults enrolled in substance use disorder treatment (n = 400), are being recruited from treatment centers in Chicago and randomly assigned to one of four conditions upon discharge in a 2 Ã— 2 factorial design. Participants receive (1) EMAs only, (2) EMIs only, (3) combined EMAs + EMIs, or (4) a control condition without EMA or EMI for 6months. People in the experimental conditions receive smartphones with the apps (EMA and/or EMI) specific to their condition. Phones alert participants in the EMA and EMA + EMI conditions at five random times per day and present participants with questions about people, places, activities, and feelings that they experienced in the past 30min and whether these factors make them want to use substances, support their recovery, or have no impact. Those in the EMI and EMA + EMI conditions have continual access to a suite of support services. In the EMA + EMI condition, participants are prompted to use the EMI(s) when responses to the EMA(s) indicate risk. All groups have access to recovery support as usual. The primary outcome is days of abstinence from alcohol and other drugs. Secondary outcomes are number of HIV risk behaviors and whether abstinence mediates the effects of EMA, EMI, or EMA + EMI on HIV risk behaviors. Discussion: This project will enable the field to learn more about the effects of EMAs and EMIs on substance use disorders and HIV risk behaviors, an understanding that could potentially make treatment and recovery more effective and more widely accessible.

Article,Virtual reality and mobile phones in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorders: A phase-2 clinical trial,"Several studies have demonstrated that exposure therapy - in which the patient is exposed to specific feared situations or objects that trigger anxiety - is an effective way to treat anxiety disorders. However, to overcome a number of limitations inherent in this approach - lack of full control of the situation, costs and time required, etc. - some therapists have started to add virtual reality (VR) to the in vivo exposure-based therapy, providing in-office, controlled exposure therapy. Compared to the in vivo exposure, VR Exposure Therapy (VRET) is completely controlled: the quality, the intensity and the frequency of the exposure are decided by the therapist, and the therapy can be stopped at any time if the patient does not tolerate it. Moreover, the flexibility of a virtual experience allows the patient to experience situations that are often much worse and more exaggerated than those that are likely to be encountered in real life. However, a critical issue underlying the use of VRET in the treatment of anxiety-related disorders is the lack of a virtual reality system in the patient's real-life context. In this paper, we present a clinical protocol for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD) based on the ubiquitous use of a biofeedback-enhanced VR system. The protocol includes the use of a mobile exposure system allowing patients to perform the virtual experience in an outpatient setting. A between-subjects study, involving 25 GAD patients, was carried out to verify the efficacy of the proposed approach. The clinical data in this pilot study seemed to support the efficacy of the ubiquitous approach. 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,C. Repetto and A.

Article,A mobile app-based intervention for depression: End-user and expert usability testing study,"Background: Despite the growing number of mental health apps available for smartphones, the perceived usability of these apps from the perspectives of end users or health care experts has rarely been reported. This information is vital, particularly for self-guided mHealth interventions, as perceptions of navigability and quality of content are likely to impact participant engagement and treatment compliance. Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a usability evaluation of a personalized, self-guided, app-based intervention for depression. Methods: Participants were administered the System Usability Scale and open-ended questions as part of a semistructured interview. There were 15 participants equally divided into 3 groups: (1) individuals with clinical depression who were the target audience for the app, (2) mental health professionals, and (3) researchers who specialize in the area of eHealth interventions and/or depression research. Results: The end-user group rated the app highly, both in quantitative and qualitative assessments. The 2 expert groups highlighted the self-monitoring features and range of established psychological treatment options (such as behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring) but had concerns that the amount and layout of content may be difficult for end users to navigate in a self-directed fashion. The end-user data did not confirm these concerns. Conclusions: Encouraging participant engagement via self-monitoring and feedback, as well as personalized messaging, may be a viable way to maintain participation in self-guided interventions. Further evaluation is necessary to determine whether levels of engagement with these features enhance treatment effects.

Article,"Adapting, pilot testing and evaluating the Kickit app to support smoking cessation for smokers with severe mental illness: A study protocol","(1) Background: While the prevalence of tobacco smoking in the general population has declined, it remains exceptionally high for smokers with severe mental illness (SMI), despite significant public health measures. This project aims to adapt, pilot test and evaluate a novel e-health smoking cessation intervention to assist relapse prevention and encourage sustained smoking cessation for young adults (aged 18â€“29 years) with SMI. (2) Methods: Using co-design principles, the researchers will adapt the Kick.it smartphone App in collaboration with a small sample of current and ex-smokers with SMI. In-depth interviews with smokers with SMI who have attempted to quit in the past 12 months and ex-smokers (i.e., those having not smoked in the past seven days) will explore their perceptions of smoking cessation support options that have been of value to them. Focus group participants will then give their feedback on the existing Kick.it App and any adaptations needed. The adapted App will then be pilot-tested with a small sample of young adult smokers with SMI interested in attempting to cut down or quit smoking, measuring utility, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes in supporting their quit efforts. (3) Conclusions: This pilot work will inform a larger definitive trial. Dependent on recruitment success, the project may extend to also include smokers with SMI who are aged 30 years or more. 2018 by the authors.

Article,Development and feasibility of smartphone application for cognitive-behavioural case management of individuals with early psychosis,"Background: This article describes the development of the smartphone application for cognitive-behavioural case management of young individuals with early psychosis and examines the acceptance and potential clinical benefits of this application through a pilot survey. Methods: Gwangju Bukgu-Community Mental Health Center developed and launched a smartphone application (Heal Your Mind [HYM]) for cognitive-behavioural case management and symptom monitoring. The HYM application for clients includes 6 main modules including thought record, symptom record, daily life record, official notices, communication and scales. The key module is the â€œthought record? for self-directed cognitive-behavioural treatment. When the client writes and sends the self-cognitive-behavioural therapy sheet to the case manager, the latter receives a notification and can provide feedback in real time. We conducted a survey to investigate the acceptance and feasibility of this approach among young clients with early psychosis. Results: A total of 24 clients with early psychosis participated in this survey. More than 80\% of participants reported that it was easy to learn to use this application, and no one described this application as very complicated or reported that they needed a long time to learn how to use it. About 80\% of participants were satisfied with this application, and 70\% reported that they received help as a result of using this application. Conclusions: This study suggests that this smartphone application is useful for young individuals with early psychosis and that it may contribute to the development of both young customer- and case manager-friendly systems for this clinical population. 2017 John Wiley \& Sons Australia, Ltd",Early Intervention in Psychiatry,J.-S.

Article,Development and pilot testing of an internet-based self-help intervention for depression for Indian users,"There is a dearth of published research on uptake and utility of mental health apps in India, despite a rising global trend in the application of technology in the field of mental health. We describe the development and pilot testing of a self-help intervention for depression, PUSH-D (Practice and Use Self-Help for Depression) for urban Indians. This guided self-help app, with essential and optional zone sections, was developed to provide a comprehensive coverage of therapeutic strategies drawn from cognitive behavior therapy, interpersonal therapy, supportive psychotherapy, and positive psychology. Pilot testing was carried out using a single group pre-, post-and follow-up design in 78 eligible participants. Participants were typically young adults with major depression or dysthymia and significant impairment in functioning. Almost two-thirds of the participants had never sought professional mental health help.

Article,"Efficacy of PRIME, a mobile app intervention designed to improve motivation in young people with schizophrenia","The onset of schizophrenia occurs during a period critical for development of social relationships and functional independence. As such, interventions that target the early course of illness have the potential to stave off functional decline and restore functioning to pre-illness levels. In this entirely remote study, people with recent-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) participated in a 12-week randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of PRIME (personalized real-time intervention for motivational enhancement), a mobile-based digital health intervention designed to improve motivation and quality of life. Participants were randomized into the PRIME (n = 22) or treatment-as-usual/waitlist (TAU/WL) condition (n = 21) and completed assessments at baseline, post-trial (12 wk), and for people in the PRIME condition, 3 months after the end of the trial. After 12-weeks, WL participants received PRIME, resulting in a total sample of 38 participants completing PRIME. In PRIME, participants worked towards self-identified goals with the support of a virtual community of age-matched peers with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders as well as motivation coaches. Compared to the WL condition, people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in self-reported depression, defeatist beliefs, self-efficacy, and a trend towards motivation/pleasure negative symptoms post-trial, and these improvements were maintained 3 months after the end of trial. We also found that people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in components of social motivation post-trial (anticipated pleasure and effort expenditure). Our results suggest that PRIME has the potential to be an effective mobile-based intervention for improving aspects of mood and motivation in young people with SSDs. 2018 OUP.

Article,Formative work in the development of a physical activity smartphone app targeted for patients with alcohol use disorders,"OBJECTIVES: Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with significant physical and mental health concerns. Interventions focused on increasing physical activity (PA) in this population may improve overall physical and mental health associated with AUDs. Given how ubiquitous smartphones have become, PA apps may be a feasible, acceptable, and potentially scalable approach to integrating PA in alcohol recovery. To date, there are no PA apps targeted specifically for this population. DESIGN: The current study describes 2 formative phases in the development of Fit\&Sober, a theory-informed smartphone app designed to increase PA in patients with alcohol dependence. METHODS: Phase 1 consisted of questionnaires and focus groups (3 groups with total N/=/23) conducted with patients in current AUD treatment regarding their preferences and feedback on the proposed app design and components. Phase 2 consisted of individual usability sessions (N/=/10) conducted with a different set of patients with AUD, in which feedback was provided on the look, usability, and functionality of the Fit\&Sober app prototype. RESULTS: Phase 1 evaluated key components of a physical activity app designed especially for increasing PA in early recovery and refined app features such as the logo, graphical display of data, and specific physical activity-relevant affect words to be used in the app. Phase 2 usability studies provided support for usability, attractiveness, and potential usefulness in the target population. CONCLUSIONS: Through the iterative 2-phase process, a prototype of the Fit\&Sober app was created and readied for pilot testing in patients with AUD.

Article,Kickit: The development of an evidence-based smoking cessation smartphone app,"Currently, the evidence for mobile health (mHealth) smoking cessation interventions is limited and heterogeneous, warranting the need for innovative rigorously developed solutions. The aim of this study was to describe the development of a smoking cessation smartphone application (app) developed using evidence-based principles. The app (Kick.it) was designed using the Intervention Mapping framework, incorporating an extensive literature review and qualitative study, in combination with the Behavioural Change Taxonomy v1, the Theoretical Domains Framework, and the Persuasive System Design framework. Kick. it provides quit smoking education, skills training, motivational content and self-regulation functionality for smokers, as well as their social support network. By logging cravings and cigarettes smoked, users will create their own smoking profile, which will be used to provide tailored interventions. It hosts a social network to allow 24/7 social support and provides in-app tools to help with urges to smoke.

Article,Mobile health (mHealth) versus clinic-based group intervention for people with serious mental illness: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: mHealth approaches that use mobile phones to deliver interventions can help improve access to care for people with serious mental illness. The goal was to evaluate how mHealth performs against more traditional treatment. Methods: A three-month randomized controlled trial was conducted of a smartphone-delivered intervention (FOCUS) versus a clinic-based group intervention (Wellness Recovery Action Plan [WRAP]). Participants were 163 clients, mostly from racial minority groups and with long-term, serious mental illness (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 49\%; bipolar disorder, 28\%; and major depressive disorder, 23\%). Outcomes were engagement throughout the intervention; satisfaction posttreatment (three months); and improvement in clinical symptoms, recovery, and quality of life (assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and six months). Results: Participants assigned to FOCUS were more likely than those assigned to WRAP to commence treatment (90\% versus 58\%) and remain fully engaged in eight weeks of care (56\% versus 40\%). Satisfaction ratings were comparably high for both interventions. Participants in both groups improved significantly and did not differ in clinical outcomes, including general psychopathology and depression. Significant improvements in recovery were seen for the WRAP group posttreatment, and significant improvements in recovery and quality of life were seen for the FOCUS group at six months. Conclusions: Both interventions produced significant gains among clients with serious and persistent mental illnesses who were mostly from racial minority groups.

Article,Reducing distress and improving social functioning in daily life in people with auditory verbal hallucinations: Study protocol for the Temstem' randomised controlled trial,"Introduction Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are prevalent experiences that can induce distress and impede social functioning. While most voice hearers benefit from antipsychotic medication or cognitive-behavioural therapy, additional effective interventions are needed to reduce the burden of experiencing AVH. Temstem' is an easily accessible and useable smartphone application that was developed by designers in close cooperation with voice hearers and experts. By using language games, Temstem aims to reduce distress and improve social functioning. Methods This is a single-blind multicentre randomised controlled trial with two arms: Temstem+AVH monitoring' versus AVH monitoring' (total n=100). Participants are adult patients who suffer daily from AVH and will be recruited in outpatient units. Primary assessment in daily life is made by the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and daily monitoring with the PsyMate app. During an ESM period of 6 days, participants assess their mental state (including AVH and context) several times a day by filling in short questionnaires. There are three 6-day ESM periods: at baseline (week 0-1), post-treatment (weeks 5-6) and follow-up (weeks 9-10). In addition, during the entire 10-week study period, all participants monitor their AVH two times a day with a short assessment via the PsyMate app. Participants in the Temstem+AVH monitoring condition are provided with the Temstem app from week 1 to 6. Other assessments made at baseline, post-treatment and follow-up are based on questionnaires and a clinical interview. Ethics and dissemination The results from this study will provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of Temstem, a non-invasive and easily accessible app for voice hearers, and insight into the determinants of optimal use. Results will be disseminated unreservedly, irrespective of the magnitude or direction of the effects.

Article,Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment and intervention in a blended coping-focused therapy for distressing voices: Development and case illustration,"Common approaches to the psychological treatment of distressing voice hearing experiences, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, aim to promote more adaptive cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses to these experiences. Digital technologies such as smartphones show promise for supporting and enhancing these treatments by linking immediate therapeutic settings to the context of daily life. Two promising technologies include ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I), which may offer a means of advanced assessment and support in daily life, and inform the tailoring of interventions to suit individual needs. In this study, a highly novel intervention approach was developed involving four face-to-face sessions with a psychologist blended with EMA/I between sessions in order to improve coping with distressing voice hearing experiences. The authors describe the background and development of this approach along-side a single case illustration, which supported feasibility and acceptability.

EMA has the potential to improve assessment and formulation of experiences which fluctuate day-to-day, and EMI may be used to prompt use of therapeutic strategies in daily life. The current study is an examination of these capabilities in the context of a brief, coping-focused intervention for distressing voice hearing experiences. Methods/design: This is a rater-blinded, pilot randomised controlled trial comparing a four-session intervention in conjunction with use of smartphone EMA/I between sessions, versus treatment-as-usual. The recruitment target is 34 participants with persisting and distressing voice hearing experiences, recruited through a Voices Clinic based in Melbourne, Australia, and via wider advertising. Allocation will be made using minimisation procedure, balancing of the frequency of voices between groups. Assessments are completed at baseline and 8 weeks post-baseline. The primary outcomes of this trial will focus on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methodology, with secondary outcomes examining preliminary clinical effects related to overall voice severity, the emotional and functional impact of the voices, and emotional distress. Discussion: This study offers a highly novel examination of specific smartphone capabilities and their integration with traditional psychological treatment for distressing voices.

InProceedings,SocioEmpathy: A social-sensitivity application to reduce stress and depression of divorce or domestic violence victims,"Divorce rate in Indonesia is the highest in the Asia Pacific. Meanwhile, the effects of divorce and domestic violence are so bad for children, especially for teenagers. The children of the divorce will show more anxiety, depression, and antisocial behavior than the child of a normal family. On the other side, the most important thing for people who are depressed is the presence of people who are willing to listen to them patiently and to not to underestimate the problem. However, depressed people don't always find people who are willing to do so when they are depressed. Thus, an application to facilitate them to share their stories and problems is needed, it is called SocioEmpathy. Methodology to develop SocioEmpathy is literature study based on scientific journals and books on ICT, and unstructured interviews towards divorce victim and professional psychologist. The result is a SocioEmpathy application that has features: 1) Timeline, 2) Personal Chat, 3) Panic Button, 4) Mood Tracker, and 5) Psychologist Consultation. The conclusion of this research is SocioEmpathy is expected to become a solution for divorce victims to ease their depression.

Article,Using mobile health gamification to facilitate cognitive behavioral therapy skills practice in child anxiety treatment: Open clinical trial,"Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy is an efficacious treatment for child anxiety disorders. Although efficacious, many children (40\%-50\%) do not show a significant reduction in symptoms or full recovery from primary anxiety diagnoses. One possibility is that they are unwilling to learn and practice cognitive behavioral therapy skills beyond therapy sessions. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including a lack of motivation, forgetfulness, and a lack of cognitive behavioral therapy skills understanding. Mobile health (mHealth) gamification provides a potential solution to improve cognitive behavioral therapy efficacy by delivering more engaging and interactive strategies to facilitate cognitive behavioral therapy skills practice in everyday lives (in vivo). Objective: The goal of this project was to redesign an existing mHealth system called SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment) so as to increase user engagement, retention, and learning facilitation by integrating gamification techniques and interactive features. Furthermore, this project assessed the effectiveness of gamification in improving user engagement and retention throughout posttreatment. Methods: We redesigned and implemented the SmartCAT system consisting of a smartphone app for children and an integrated clinician portal. The gamified app contains (1) a series of interactive games and activities to reinforce skill understanding, (2) an in vivo skills coach that cues the participant to use cognitive behavioral therapy skills during real-world emotional experiences, (3) a home challenge module to encourage home-based exposure tasks, (4) a digital reward system that contains digital points and trophies, and (5) a therapist-patient messaging interface. Therapists used a secure Web-based portal connected to the app to set up required activities for each session, receive or send messages, manage participant rewards and challenges, and view data and figures summarizing the app usage. The system was implemented as an adjunctive component to brief cognitive behavioral therapy in an open clinical trial. To evaluate the effectiveness of gamification, we compared the app usage data at posttreatment with the earlier version of SmartCAT without gamification. Results: Gamified SmartCAT was used frequently throughout treatment. On average, patients spent 35.59 min on the app (SD 64.18) completing 13.00 activities between each therapy session (SD 12.61). At the 0.10 significance level, the app usage of the gamified system (median 68.00) was higher than that of the earlier, nongamified SmartCAT version (median 37.00, U=76.00, P{\textbackslash}textless.01). The amount of time spent on the gamified system (median 173.15) was significantly different from that of the earlier version (median 120.73, U=173.00, P=.06). Conclusions: The gamified system showed good acceptability, usefulness, and engagement among anxious children receiving brief cognitive behavioral therapy treatment. Integrating an mHealth gamification platform within treatment for anxious children seems to increase involvement in shorter treatment. Further study is needed to evaluate increase in involvement in full-length treatment.

Article,Development and Pilot Evaluation of Smartphone-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy Strategies for Mood- and Anxiety-Related Problems: MoodMission,"Given the ubiquity and interactive power of smartphones, there are opportunities to develop smartphone applications (apps) that provide novel, highly accessible mental health supports. This paper details the development of a smartphone app, â€œMoodMission,ï¿½? that aims to provide evidence-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) strategies for mood- and anxiety-related problems, contributing to the prevention of clinically significant depression and anxiety disorders and serving as an adjunct to therapeutic interventions delivered by trained health professionals. MoodMission was designed to deliver strategies in the form of real-time, momentary responses to user-reported low moods and anxiety. The development process involved: (a) construction of a battery of strategies, (b) empirical evaluation, (c) a software and behavioral plan design and testing process, (d) user feedback, and (e) a public launch. A pilot study of 44 participants completed the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS; Hides et al., 2014) for usability testing and feedback. MoodMission was rated significantly higher than standardized health app norms on the majority of the domains, including Entertainment, Interest, Customization, Target Group, Graphics, Visual Appeal, Quality of Information, Quantity of Information, Visual Information, Credibility of Source, Recommendation to Use, Estimated Frequency of Use, and Overall Rating (Hedges's g range 0.57â€“1.97, p {\textbackslash}textless.006). Case examples illustrate the practical uses of the app. In addition to clinical applications, MoodMission holds promise as a research tool either as an augmentation to clinician-delivered therapy, or as a vehicle for standardizing client access to specific CBT strategies (e.g., in studies intending to study different change processes). 2018",Cognitive and Behavioral Practice,N.

Article,A feasibility study of a mental health mobile app in the Dominican Republic: The untold story,"Mobile health (mHealth) interventions include mental health apps (MHapps). There are hundreds of MHapps, which have been touted as a means of revolutionizing mental health care delivery. In spite of the rosy outlook and promise of MHapps, there are challenges to implementation in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). We report on several domains of implementation: acceptance, appropriateness, engagement, and work processes assessed in two samples of clinicians and patients designed to develop and test the feasibility of a Spanish language Cognitive Behavioral VoiceThreadÂ® app for Dominican primary care patients with depression. Results indicated that feasibility of our eMH intervention was compromised by appropriateness of the target audience and the eligibility criteria used, including language, age, access to phones, and access to the internet. Both participants and clinical providers had varying degrees of engagement in the MHapp. Clinical providers had a desire for increased knowledge and capacity building, but also unspoken expectations and misaligned incentives. For participants, there were logistical and emotional barriers to use, some of which could not be fully determined in this study due to a lack of feasibility in terms of a low retention rate. Corresponding to these issues, we identified four potential solutions: 1) understanding of characteristics of end-users; 2) engagement of key stakeholders; 3) working within the existing infrastructure; and 4) addressing the social determinants of health. Unforeseen strengths also emerged as a result of our investigations.

Article,Using the Social-Local-Mobile App for Smoking Cessation in the SmokeFreeBrain Project: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Smoking is considered the main cause of preventable illness and early deaths worldwide. The treatment usually prescribed to people who wish to quit smoking is a multidisciplinary intervention, combining both psychological advice and pharmacological therapy, since the application of both strategies significantly increases the chance of success in a quit attempt. Objective: We present a study protocol of a 12-month randomized open-label parallel-group trial whose primary objective is to analyze the efficacy and efficiency of usual psychopharmacological therapy plus the Social-Local-Mobile app (intervention group) applied to the smoking cessation process compared with usual psychopharmacological therapy alone (control group). Methods: The target population consists of adult smokers (both male and female) attending the Smoking Cessation Unit at Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain. Social-Local-Mobile is an innovative intervention based on mobile technologies and their capacity to trigger behavioral changes. The app is a complement to pharmacological therapies to quit smoking by providing personalized motivational messages, physical activity monitoring, lifestyle advice, and distractions (minigames) to help overcome cravings. Usual pharmacological therapy consists of bupropion (Zyntabac 150 mg) or varenicline (Champix 0.5 mg or 1 mg). The main outcomes will be (1) the smoking abstinence rate at 1 year measured by means of exhaled carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine tests, and (2) the result of the cost-effectiveness analysis, which will be expressed in terms of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcome measures will be (1) analysis of the safety of pharmacological therapy, (2) analysis of the health-related quality of life of patients, and (3) monitoring of healthy lifestyle and physical exercise habits. Results: Of 548 patients identified using the hospital's electronic records system, we excluded 308 patients: 188 declined to participate and 120 did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 240 patients were enrolled: the control group (n=120) will receive usual psychopharmacological therapy, while the intervention group (n=120) will receive usual psychopharmacological therapy plus the So-Lo-Mo app. The project was approved for funding in June 2015. Enrollment started in October 2016 and was completed in October 2017. Data gathering was completed in November 2018, and data analysis is under way. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in early 2019.

Article,"Self-directed engagement with a mobile app (sinasprite) and its effects on confidence in coping skills, depression, and anxiety: retrospective longitudinal study","Background: Inadequacies in mental health care coverage remain an enormous problem in the United States. Barriers include scarcity of accessible mental health care professionals. Use of a mental health mobile app incorporating social cognitive theory may help improve confidence in coping skills and improve anxiety and depression. Sinasprite is a mobile app that recruited users via self-referral and clinician referral. Users completed questionnaires to obtain demographic and medical histories. At baseline and 6-week follow-up, users completed the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8), General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7), and the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (CSE). It is unknown how self-directed use of a mobile app improves confidence in coping skills and its effects on self-reported depression and anxiety. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the Sinasprite database to assess self-directed engagement and how use of this mobile app impacted self-reported confidence in coping skills and severity of depression and anxiety. Methods: This retrospective longitudinal study involved users recruited via clinician referral and self-referral through social media and news media. Questionnaires were used to record demographic, medical, and prescription medication histories. Mental health status was assessed via PHQ-8, GAD-7, and CSE questionnaires. A deidentified dataset reporting mobile app use data was provided to investigators. Individuals with verifiable usage data and at least one completed questionnaire at 6 weeks of use were included. Mannâ€“Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess whether demographic data and psychotherapy were related to baseline questionnaire scores and usage. A Spearman rho (ï¿½?) test was used to assess the relationship between improvement in the CSE and GAD-7 and PHQ-8 questionnaires. Changes in mental health status were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A mixed-effects repeated-measures linear regression model assessed the main effects of time, concomitant counseling, and psychotropic prescription medication use on mental health status. Results: Thirty-four users were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Users were predominantly female, white, married, and college educated. At baseline, 35\% (12/34) of respondents reported the use of individual/group counseling, and 38\% (19/34) reported using prescription medications for their mental health. The median user completed 5.7 (interquartile range 2.7-14.1) trackable activities per week. Statistically significant improvements using a Wilcoxon signed-ranked test were observed in the PHQ-8 (P{\textbackslash}textless.001), GAD-7 (P=.002), and CSE (P{\textbackslash}textless.001) questionnaire scores. A strong positive correlation between improvement in the GAD-7 and CSE questionnaire scores (ï¿½?=.572, P=.001, n=28) was observed. The mixed-effects repeated-measures regression model revealed a statistically significant effect of time on improvements in the PHQ-8 (P{\textbackslash}textless.001), GAD-7 (P=.007), and CSE (P=.001). Conclusions: This 6-week retrospective study showed that self-directed use of the mobile app, Sinasprite, resulted in significant improvements in self-reported questionnaire scores reflecting depression, anxiety, and confidence in coping skills.

The unguided POI addressed behavioral activation and depressive thinking in a single module with 25 webpages (including a smartphone application). We did one assessment at baseline and a post-assessment four weeks later. Results: At post-assessment, depression (p =.586), behavioral activation (p =.332), and dysfunctional attitudes (p =.499) did not differ between groups. When concurrent treatments (medication/psychotherapy) remained constant/decreased, the POI outperformed TAU (p =.031). POI-participants with lower willingness to change (p =.030) or higher education (p =.017) were less likely to worsen (i.e., experience increased depressive symptoms) compared to TAU. Discussion: The targeted sample size was not reached, measurements were self-reported, and randomization failed. The POI's content may have been too limited. Concurrent treatments, which were more often sought out by TAU participants, diminished group differences and should be considered in future studies. Brief POIs may protect against worsening of depressive symptoms among highly educated participants or those with low willingness to change. 2018 The Authors",Internet Interventions,S.

InProceedings,ICare-stress: An integrated mental health software,"Not only the psychiatric problem is complicated but screening and diagnosing processes also consume much time to get better treatment. Currently, there is a scarce number of psychiatrists and tools for helping people to assess and manage their level of anxiety and depression. This research extended our previous work on detecting stress using brainwave and neurofeedback [14] to invent an Integrated Mental Health Software tool for early screening, detection, diagnosis, and early treatment mobile application called 'Intelligent Caring System for Stress' or 'iCare-Stress'. Based on the expert's recommendation, iCare-Stress uses the set of most efficient and evidence-based screening tools which are General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Moreover, the psychoeducation of the basic knowledge of diseases and how to handle them by using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is provided. This work proposed the iCare-Stress system architecture and its prototype. The fundamental usability test has been done by the medical and non-medical testers and the result shows a high satisfactory level from both groups. The ultimate goal of iCare-Stress aims to help people to understand the psychiatric problem early and a timely diagnosis would be done to result in better treatment outcome which will reduce effects to both individual and others. 2017 IEEE.",NA,Jarernsri Mitrpanont and Jaruwan Phandhu-Fung and Nantanut Klubdee and Supanat Ratanalaor and Teeranan Mitrpanont,2018,PHQ,433 - iCare-Stress An Integrated Mental,433,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,iCare-stress,Thailand,24-Various disorders,24,Various disorders,NA,4-Depressive disorders; 5-Anxiety disorders,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND PROTOTYPE STUDY,"the result shows that our application is at the very good level in design, media, psychoeducation and the performance for the target group who are in the medical related area in which they found our system is very useful and helpful.",30,NA,NA,YES,USABILITY/UX,NO,Thailand
Article,"The WorkingWell Mobile Phone App for Individuals With Serious Mental Illnesses: Proof-of-Concept, Mixed-Methods Feasibility Study","Background: The disparities in employment for individuals with serious mental illnesses have been well documented, as have the benefits of work. Mobile technology can provide accessible in-the-moment support for these individuals. The WorkingWell mobile app was developed to meet the need for accessible follow-along supports for individuals with serious mental illnesses in the workplace. Objective: We explore the usability, usage, usefulness, and overall feasibility of the WorkingWell mobile app with individuals with serious mental illnesses who are actively employed and receiving community-based services. Methods: In this proof-of-concept, mixed-methods, 2-month feasibility study (N=40), employed individuals with serious mental illnesses were recruited in mental health agencies. Participants completed surveys regarding background characteristics and cellphone use at enrollment and responded to interview items regarding app usability, usage, and usefulness in technical assistance calls at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks of participation and in the exit interview at 8 weeks. Data on the frequency of app usage were downloaded on a daily basis. A version of the System Usability Scale (SUS) was administered in the exit interview. Overall feasibility was determined by the percent of users completing the study, responses to an interview item regarding continued use, and findings on usability, usage, and usefulness. General impressions were obtained from users regarding user support materials, technical assistance, and study procedures. Results: Most participants were male (60\%, 24/40), aged 55 or younger (70\%, 28/40), white (80\%, 32/40), had less than a 4-year college education (78\%, 31/40), were employed part-time (98\%, 39/40), had been working more than 6 months (60\%, 24/40), and indicated a diagnosis of bipolar, schizoaffective, or depressive disorder (84\%, 16/25). The majority of participants owned cellphones (95\%, 38/40) and used them multiple times per day (83\%, 33/40).

Article,Cognitive behavioral intervention via a smartphone app for non-professional caregivers with depressive symptoms: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Although major depression is a frequent disorder in non-professional caregivers and there are effective psychological interventions to prevent it, caregivers have difficulty accessing them. Interventions for depression applied through an app could improve accessibility; yet, to date, adherence to such interventions has been low. The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral depression prevention intervention administered through a smartphone app with and without telephone conference calls, (2) analyze the mediators of the change in the incidence of depression and depressive symptoms, and (3) assess adherence and satisfaction with the interventions. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted. Caregivers with elevated symptoms will be randomly assigned to a cognitive behavioral intervention administered by a smartphone app (CBIA) group, a CBIA plus telephone conference calls (TCCs) group (CBIA + TCC), or an attention control group. Each condition will consist of approximately 58 participants. Both interventions will be administered in five modules through a smartphone app and the CBIA + TCC group will receive additional TCCs in group format (four sessions of 30min each). Trained blind assessors will conduct pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-up assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12months. Discussion: This study will provide evidence of the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral intervention to prevent depression in caregivers with elevated depressive symptoms administered through a smartphone app and the impact of feedback applied through conference calls to increase program adherence and efficacy. If the results were favorable, it would mean that we have developed a more effective, accessible, and clinically useful preventive depression intervention than the currently available ones for many present and future caregivers. 2018 The Author(s).",Trials,L.

InProceedings,Pocket skills: A conversational Mobile web app to support dialectical behavioral therapy,"Mental health disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide. Although evidence-based psychotherapy is effective, engagement from such programs can be low. Mobile apps have the potential to help engage and support people in their therapy. We developed Pocket Skills, a mobile web app based on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Pocket Skills teaches DBT via a conversational agent modeled on Marsha Linehan, who developed DBT. We examined the feasibility of Pocket Skills in a 4-week field study with 73 individuals enrolled in psychotherapy. After the study, participants reported decreased depression and anxiety and increased DBT skills use. We present a model based on qualitative findings of how Pocket Skills supported DBT. Pocket Skills helped participants engage in their DBT and practice and implement skills in their environmental context, which enabled them to see the results of using their DBT skills and increase their self-efficacy. We discuss the design implications of these findings for future mobile mental health systems. 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",NA,Jessica Schroeder and Chelsey Wilkes and Kael Rowan and Arturo Toledo and Ann Paradiso and Mary Czerwinski and Gloria Mark and Marsha M Linehan,2018,Health informatics,436 - Pocket Skills A Conversational Mobile Web,436,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,Pocket Skills,United States of America,24-Various disorders,24,Various disorders,NA,4-Depressive disorders; 5-Anxiety disorders,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,FEASIBILITY STUDY,"After the study, participants reported decreased depression and anxiety and increased DBT skills use.",73,NA,Unique,YES,EFFECT AND USABILITY/UX,NO,United States of America
Article,A pilot study of a smartphone application supporting recovery from drug addiction,"Background: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to facilitate self-monitoring and self-management for individuals with substance use disorders (SUD). S-Health is a bilingual smartphone application based on cognitive behavioral principles and is designed to support recovery from drug addiction by trigger recognition so as to allow practice in-the-moment coping to prevent relapse. Method: For this pilot randomized controlled study, 75 participants were recruited from methadone maintenance treatment clinics and the social worker consortium in Shanghai, China. Participants in the control group (N = 25) received text messages from S-Health (e.g., HIV prevention and other educational materials). Participants in the intervention group (N = 50) received both text messages and daily surveys on cravings, affects, triggers, responses to triggers, and social contexts. Results: At the end of the 1-month study trial, 26.2\% of the intervention group and 50\% of the control group had positive urine test results (p = 0.06). Also, the number of days using drug in the past week was significantly lower among participants in the intervention group (Mean = 0.71, SD = 1.87) relative to the control group (Mean = 2.20, SD = 3.06) (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). The two groups did not differ in slopes (i.e., rates of change in outcomes measured weekly) based on the mixed effects model. Participants in the intervention group also preferred answering questions on the cellphone (46.8\%) relative to in-person interviews (36.2\%). Conclusions: This pilot demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits to deliver mobile health intervention among participants with SUD. Further research with larger samples over a longer period of time is needed to test the effectiveness of S-Health as a self-monitoring tool supporting recovery from addiction. 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment,Y.-I.

Article,A smartphone application for treating depressive symptoms: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Depression is a commonly occurring disorder linked to diminished role functioning and quality of life. The development of treatments that overcome barriers to accessing treatment remains an important area of clinical research as most people delay or do not receive treatment at an appropriate time. The workplace is an ideal setting to roll-out an intervention, particularly given the substantial psychological benefits associated with remaining in the workforce. Mobile health (mhealth) interventions utilising smartphone applications (apps) offer novel solutions to disseminating evidence based programs, however few apps have undergone rigorous testing. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone app designed to treat depressive symptoms in workers. Methods: The present study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), comparing the effectiveness of the intervention to that of an attention control. The primary outcome measured will be reduced depressive symptoms at 3 months. Secondary outcomes such as wellbeing and work performance will also be measured. Employees from a range of industries will be recruited via a mixture of targeted social media advertising and Industry partners. Participants will be included if they present with likely current depression at baseline. Following baseline assessment (administered within the app), participants will be randomised to receive one of two versions of the Headgear application: 1) Intervention (a 30-day mental health intervention focusing on behavioural activation and mindfulness), or 2) attention control app (mood monitoring for 30 days). Participants will be blinded to their allocation. Analyses will be conducted within an intention to treat framework using mixed modelling.

Article,Actissist: Proof-of-concept trial of a theory-driven digital intervention for psychosis,"Background: Timely access to intervention for psychosis is crucial yet problematic. As such, health care providers are forming digital strategies for addressing mental health challenges. A theory-driven digital intervention that monitors distressing experiences and provides real-time active management strategies could improve the speed and quality of recovery in psychosis, over and above conventional treatments. This study assesses the feasibility and acceptability of Actissist, a digital health intervention grounded in the cognitive model of psychosis that targets key early psychosis domains. Methods: A proof-of-concept, single, blind, randomized controlled trial of Actissist, compared to a symptom-monitoring control. Thirty-six early psychosis patients were randomized on a 2:1 ratio to each arm of the trial. Actissist was delivered via a smartphone app over 12-weeks; clinical and functional assessment time-points were baseline, post-treatment and 22-weeks. Assessors' blind to treatment condition conducted the assessments. Acceptability was examined using qualitative methods. Results: Actissist was feasible (75\% participants used Actissist at least once/day; uptake was high, 97\% participants remained in the trial; high follow-up rates), acceptable (90\% participants recommend Actissist), and safe (0 serious adverse events), with high levels of user satisfaction. Treatment effects were large on negative symptoms, general psychotic symptoms and mood. The addition of Actissist conferred benefit at post-treatment assessment over routine symptom-monitoring and treatment as usual. Conclusions: This is the first controlled proof-of-concept trial of a theory-driven digital health intervention for early psychosis.

Article,Correlates of Mental Health Smartphone Application Use among Patients with Suicidal Ideation,"Mental health applications (apps) can improve access to evidence-based, mental health strategies. This study evaluated predictors of use for the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app designed to enhance coping among high-risk mental health populations. We also explored the impact of usage on health outcomes. We analyzed data drawn from the treatment arm of a randomized clinical trial of the VHB (n = 58). Veterans at high risk of suicide used the app over 12 weeks and completed psychosocial assessments throughout the study. We received usage data from each participantâ€™s smartphone. We then used negative binomial regression to evaluate demographic and clinical predictors of usage and generalized estimating equations to explore the longitudinal association between usage and psychosocial outcomes. The most commonly used subcomponents were designed to provide distractions and reminders of sources of meaning. Lower levels of usage were associated with younger and having a 2-year college degree or higher. Exploratory findings suggested a possible relationship between usage and protective factors. Certain subgroups had lower VHB usage. The findings suggest usage may be associated with changes in health outcomes.

Article,Investigation of a Mobile serious Game in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Pilot Study,"Objective: Exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy is considered a first-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Dysregulation in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit has been implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD, as have decreased functional connectivity (FC) between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the prefrontal cortex and increased FC between the dACC and the basal ganglia. We hypothesized that a new ERP-inspired mobile {""}serious game{""} would improve clinical symptoms in OCD and that symptom improvement would be associated with altered FC within CSTC. Materials and Methods: Fifteen OCD subjects and 15 healthy controls were recruited. All subjects completed questionnaires covering demographic data, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Beck Depressive Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. In addition, all subjects were scanned at baseline to assess brain FC using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: After 3 weeks of gameplay, FC from the left dACC seed to the right frontal precentral gyrus and from the right dACC seed to the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus, increased in the OCD group. Responders showed increased brain connectivity from the left dACC seed to the right superior frontal gyrus compared with nonresponders. Conclusion: Our results suggest that serious games may improve symptoms in OCD and that this improvement may be related to increased brain connectivity between the dACC and the prefrontal cortex.

Article,PTSD Coach around the world,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a global public health problem. Unfortunately, many individuals with PTSD do not receive professional care due to a lack of available providers, stigma about mental illness, and other concerns. Technology-based interventions, including mobile phone applications (apps) may be a viable means of surmounting such barriers and reaching and helping those in need. Given this potential, in 2011 the U.S Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD released PTSD Coach, a mobile app intended to provide psycho-education and self-management tools for trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms. Emerging research on PTSD Coach demonstrates high user satisfaction, feasibility, and improvement in PTSD symptoms and other psychosocial outcomes. A model of openly sharing the app's source code and content has resulted in versions being created by individuals in six other countries: Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. These versions are described, highlighting their significant adaptations, enhancements, and expansions to the original PTSD Coach app as well as emerging research on them.

InProceedings,Smart Phone Based Facial and Text Recognition Application (RICO),"In our everyday lives, more people are being diagnosed with assorted types of diseases; both mentally and physically. One of them being a life changing mental disease called Alzheimer. Within time and as people grow in age, more and more people are being diagnosed with that disease. Alzheimer disease is a type of disorder that affects the mental functions of the brain resulting in memory loss, which causes its patients to suffer from difficulty in recognizing faces they are familiar with. Moreover, patients tend to have problems interacting with the people surrounding them. Since there is no certain cure for this dementia, one of the ways we could contribute to help patients get along with this disease is by proposing a smart phone based facial and text recognition application (RICO). Rico does not aim to only help Alzheimer patients but can also help people with weak eyesight by recognizing and reading text. Rico has the ability to help early stage Alzheimer's patients identify people they interact with on daily basis. Rico is an application uses smart phone's camera to recognize faces, and then notify the patient. The application displays a brief description regarding the person's relation with the patient. The database contains familiar faces that the user most likely will interact with.

Article,Smartphone-based safety planning and self-monitoring for suicidal patients: Rationale and study protocol of the CASPAR (Continuous Assessment for Suicide Prevention And Research) study,"Background: It remains difficult to predict and prevent suicidal behaviour, despite growing understanding of the aetiology of suicidality. Clinical guidelines recommend that health care professionals develop a safety plan in collaboration with their high-risk patients, to lower the imminent risk of suicidal behaviour. Mobile health applications provide new opportunities for safety planning, and enable daily self-monitoring of suicide-related symptoms that may enhance safety planning. This paper presents the rationale and protocol of the Continuous Assessment for Suicide Prevention And Research (CASPAR) study. The aim of the study is two-fold: to evaluate the feasibility of mobile safety planning and daily mobile self-monitoring in routine care treatment for suicidal patients, and to conduct fundamental research on suicidal processes. Methods: The study is an adaptive single cohort design among 80 adult outpatients or day-care patients, with the main diagnosis of major depressive disorder or dysthymia, who have an increased risk for suicidal behaviours. There are three measurement points, at baseline, at 1 and 3 months after baseline. Patients are instructed to use their mobile safety plan when necessary and monitor their suicidal symptoms daily. Both these apps will be used in treatment with their clinician. Conclusion: The results from this study will provide insight into the feasibility of mobile safety planning and self-monitoring in treatment of suicidal patients. Furthermore, knowledge of the suicidal process will be enhanced, especially regarding the transition from suicidal ideation to behaviour. The study protocol is currently under revision for medical ethics approval by the medical ethics board of the Vrije Universiteit Medical centre Amsterdam (METc number 2017.512/NL62795.029.17). 2018 The Authors",Internet Interventions,A.

Article,Transdiagnostic tailored internet- and mobile-based guided treatment for major depressive disorder and comorbid anxiety: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Introduction: Depression is highly prevalent and often accompanied by comorbid anxiety disorder. Internet-based interventions have shown to be one effective treatment modality; however, comorbidities are often not targeted. Transdiagnostic tailored internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) might be promising to overcome such issues. Aim: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, moderators, and cost-effectiveness of a transdiagnostic tailored internet- and mobile-based guided intervention for depression and comorbid anxiety in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Two-hundred participants with MDD will be randomly assigned to an 8-week guided self-help internet intervention (IC) or a 6-month wait-list control group (WLC). Participants of the IC will receive weekly content-focused feedback on module completion as well as monitored adherence reminders from an eCoach. The primary outcome is clinician-rated depression severity (QIDS-C) at post-assessment assessed by diagnostic raters blind to study condition. Secondary outcomes include, e.g., change in diagnostic status (MDD and anxiety disorders), remission and response rates, disorder symptom severity, health related quality of life, incongruence related to needs and values, and behavioral activation. Assessments will take place at baseline (T1), post-assessment (T2), 6-month follow-up (T3), and 12-month follow-up in the IC. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. A large number of a priori defined moderators of treatment outcome will be assessed at baseline and tested in predicting treatment outcome. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from a societal perspective. Discussion: The present study will provide evidence on the efficacy, potential cost-effectiveness, and moderators of a transdiagnostic tailored guided internet- and mobile-based treatment protocol. 2018 Weisel, Zarski, Berger, Schaub, Krieger, Moser, Berking and Ebert.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,D.D.

Article,Virtual Reality Tool Simulates MRI Experience,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an extremely useful tool for the detection and characterization of numerous pathologic processes. Although patients can benefit from the use of MRI, claustrophobia is a major issue in some cases. This fear alone can lead to cancellation of the scanning procedure in some cases and the need for conscious sedation in others. Patient anxiety during the scan can also lead to increased motion-related artifacts on the images with associated degradation of the diagnostic quality the study. To alleviate these problems, our team developed a virtual reality (VR) tool (app) to educate patients about MRI and simulate the experience of actually being scanned. The app is totally immersive and incorporates both the visual and auditory sensations that patients encounter during an MRI scan. Patients also learn about potential conditions and implanted devices that may preclude the safe performance of the examination. This VR tool not only educates patients about MRI and its importance in their care, but also allows them to virtually experience what it is like to have a MRI scan. This technology has the potential to decrease both claustrophobic cancellations and patient anxiety before a MRI scan.",Tomography,Daniel Fessahazion,2018,NA,457 - Virtual Reality Tool Simulates MRI Experience,457,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NA,United States of America,5-Anxiety disorders,5,Anxiety disorders,NA,Clautrophobia,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,PROTOTYPE STUDY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO,NO ASSESSMENT,NO,United States of America
Article,OpenSIMPLe: A real-world implementation feasibility study of a smartphone-based psychoeducation programme for bipolar disorder,"Background: Few evidence-based mental health apps are widely available to patients and, conversely, many of the available apps have not been appropriately evaluated. Given that the ultimate goal is to scale-up and open internet-based platforms (IBP), it is crucial to appropriately evaluate their real-world feasibility beforehand. We aimed to evaluate the implementation feasibility of a smartphone-based psychoeducational programme for bipolar disorder, exploring its long-term retention, usability, perceived helpfulness and satisfaction, alongside its impact on secondary health outcomes. Methods: Participants were recruited via the project website after completing an online screening questionnaire. They were requested to complete web-based questionnaires before using the app and after 6 months of use which included sociodemographic, illness and treatment variables, the world health organisation-five well-being index (WHO-5) and the short form health survey (SF-36). The follow-up questionnaires also contained satisfaction and usefulness questions. Results: 201 participants took part in the study. According to their retention, 66.2\% of the participants were classified as nonâ€“completers and 33.8\% as completers. The only predictor significantly associated with higher odds of retention was older age (OR = 1.021, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). 62\% of the users reported they were satisfied with the programme with a higher percentage among completers. Who-5 baseline and follow-up scores showed a significant improvement as well as 6 out of 8 domains of the SF-36. Limitations: Screening and outcome measures were administered using exclusively self-reported online methods. Conclusion: The 6-month attrition rate of the programme was high. Positive outcomes regarding satisfaction were found predominantly among completers. The optimal dosage and retention of IBP mental health programmes remain challenging issues that need further research. 2018",Journal of Affective Disorders,F.

Article,Patient experiences using a self-monitoring app in eating disorder treatment: Qualitative study,"Background: The Recovery Record smartphone app is a self-monitoring tool for individuals recovering from an eating disorder. Unlike traditional pen-and-paper meal diaries, which are often used in eating disorder treatment, the app holds novel features, such as meal reminders, affirmations, and patient-clinician in-app linkage, the latter allowing for clinicians to continuously monitor patients' app data. Objective: To explore patients' experiences with using Recovery Record as part of outpatient eating disorder treatment. Methods: A total of 41 patients from a Danish eating disorder treatment facility were included in the study. All 41 patients participated in participant observations of individual or group treatment sessions, and 26 were interviewed about their experiences with using the app in treatment. The data material was generated and analyzed concurrently, applying the inductive methodology of Interpretive Description. Results: The patients' experiences with Recovery Record depended on its app features, the impact of these features on patients, and their specific app usage. This patient-app interaction affected and was affected by changeable contexts making patients' experiences dynamic. The patient-app interaction affected patients' placement of specific Recovery Record app features along a continuum from supportive to obstructive of individual everyday life activities including the eating disorder treatment. As an example, some patients found it supportive being notified by their clinician when their logs had been monitored as it gave them a sense of relatedness. Contrarily, other patients felt under surveillance, which was obstructive, as it made them feel uneasy or even dismissing the app. Conclusions: Some patients experienced the app and its features as mostly supportive of their everyday life and the eating disorder treatment, while others experienced it primarily as obstructive. When applying apps in eating disorder treatment, we therefore recommend that patients and clinicians collaborate to determine how the app in question best fits the capacities, preferences, and treatment needs of the individual patient. Thus, we encourage patients and clinicians to discuss how specific features of the applied app affect the individual patient to increase the use of supportive features, while limiting the use of obstructive ones.

Article,Mobile Technology for Treatment Augmentation in Veteran Smokers With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Introduction: The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of incorporating a mobile application, Stay Quit Coach, into an integrated care smoking-cessation treatment protocol for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: Participants included veteran smokers aged 18-69 years with PTSD. The integrated care protocol includes eight weekly PTSD-informed cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for smoking cessation, followed by monthly booster sessions and a prescription for standard smoking-cessation medications if desired. Participants used Stay Quit Coach as desired. Outcome measures at 3-month follow-up included: adherence (sessions attended), 30-day point-prevalence abstinence bioverified with carbon monoxide {\textbackslash}textless6 parts per million, past-30 day mean daily cigarette use, exhaled carbon monoxide, nicotine dependence, and PTSD symptom severity. Repeated outcomes were analyzed with random-intercept linear mixed models. Data were collected in 2015-2016 and analyses were conducted in 2016-2017. Results: Participants (n=20) were 95\% male and 5\% female; mean age 41.4 (SD=16.2) years. Thirteen participants (65\%) attended all scheduled sessions, four (20\%) did not adhere to the protocol on schedule, and three (15\%) were lost to follow-up. At 3-month follow-up, six of 17 completers (35.3\%) had bioverified 30-day point-prevalence abstinence. Nicotine dependence, carbon monoxide levels, and past 30-day cigarette use significantly decreased and PTSD symptoms were unchanged from baseline to follow-up. Participants self-reported using Stay Quit Coach 2.5 (SD=2.2) days/week; 15 of 17 (88.2\%) reported using Stay Quit Coach {\textbackslash}textless30 minutes/week; two of 17 (11.8\%) reported using Stay Quit Coach 30-60 minutes/week.

Article,Adding a smartphone app to internet-based self-help for social anxiety: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Increasing access to treatment via smartphone apps is an important topic in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). â€˜Challengerâ€™ is an app promoting exposure exercises in daily life. The present study evaluated the additional benefit of using the app as adjunct to Internet-based unguided self-help for SAD. In a second step, we also tested how the app and the self-help programme (SH) should best be combined. Method: 209 patients diagnosed with SAD were randomly allocated to three groups. Group 1 received the app and the self-help programme for six weeks (parallel treatment), group 2 first received SH for six weeks and then the app for six weeks (sequential treatment). Group 3 was a wait-list group. Comparisons were made at week 7 evaluating the potential add-on effect of the app (SH plus app versus SH only) and at week 14 comparing the parallel to the sequential treatment. Participants filled in questionnaires prior, during, and post treatment, and at 4- and 12- months follow-up. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant effect of adding the app to Internet-based self-help. However, among participants actively using the app, adding Challenger to self-help resulted in significantly less social anxiety (d = 0.30). At week 14, decreases in social anxiety were large for both the parallel and the sequential group with no differences between the active groups (d within = 1.12â€“1.19). Changes were maintained throughout the follow-up period. Conclusion: Results of the current study cautiously support the notion of adding a smartphone app to unguided self-help for SAD.

Article,A randomized controlled trial on a smartphone self-help application (Be Good to Yourself) to reduce depressive symptoms,"Depressive symptoms are common, yet only a subgroup of individuals receive adequate treatment. To reduce the treatment gap, several online self-help programs have been developed, yielding small to moderate effects. We developed a smartphone self-help application addressing depressive symptoms. We sought to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy in participants reporting a subjective need for help (a diagnosis of depression was not mandatory). We conducted a randomized controlled trial (N = 90). The primary outcome was a reduction of depressive symptoms measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Secondary outcomes included improved self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). The intervention group obtained access to the application for four weeks, the wait-list group received access after the post assessment. No group differences emerged in either outcome in intention-to-treat analyses. Per protocol analyses with frequent users (i.e., several times a week or more) yielded a small effect size (Î· 2 p = 0.049) at trend level on the reduction of depressive symptoms in favor of the treatment group.

Method: Across two sites, 66 adolescents hospitalized for suicidal ideation (N=26) or a recent suicide attempt (N=40) were randomly assigned to the ASAP intervention program plus treatment as usual or to treatment as usual alone. ASAP, which focuses on emotion regulation and safety planning, is a 3-hour intervention delivered on the inpatient unit. The BRITE app prompted participants to rate their level of emotional distress on a daily basis and provided personalized strategies for emotion regulation and safety planning. A blind, independent evaluator assessed suicide attempts following hospital discharge and suicidal ideation at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after discharge. Results: The ASAP intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on suicide attempt, although findings were in the hypothesized direction for occurrence of an attempt (16\% compared with 31\%; x2=1.86, df=1, g=20.36) and time to an attempt (hazard ratio=0.49, 95\% CI=0.16, 1.47). Past history of a suicide attempt was a significant moderator of treatment outcome, with a stronger, albeit nonsignificant, effect of the ASAP intervention among participants with a history of suicide attempt (hazard ratio=0.23, 95\% CI=0.05, 1.09). There were no treatment effects on suicidal ideation. The majority of participants (70\%) used the BRITE app (median usage, 19 times).

Article,A smartphone app to foster power in the everyday management of living with schizophrenia: Qualitative analysis of young adults perspectives,"Background: Literature indicates that using smartphone technology is a feasible way of empowering young adults recently diagnosed with schizophrenia to manage everyday living with their illness. The perspective of young adults on this matter, however, is unexplored. Objective: This study aimed at exploring how young adults recently diagnosed with schizophrenia used and perceived a smartphone app (MindFrame) as a tool to foster power in the everyday management of living with their illness. Methods: Using participatory design thinking and methods, MindFrame was iteratively developed. MindFrame consists of a smartphone app that allows young adults to access resources to aid their self-management. The app is affiliated with a website to support collaboration with their health care providers (HCPs). From January to December 2016, community-dwelling young adults with a recent diagnosis of schizophrenia were invited to use MindFrame as part of their care. They customized the resources while assessing their health on a daily basis. Then, they were invited to evaluate the use and provide their perspective on the app. The evaluation was qualitative, and data were generated from in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed using a hermeneutical approach. Results: A total of 98 individuals were eligible for the study (mean age 24.8, range 18-36). Of these, 27 used MindFrame and 13 participated in the evaluation. The analysis showed that to the young adults, MindFrame served to foster power in their everyday management of living with schizophrenia. When MindFrame was used with the HCPs consistently for more than a month, it could provide them with the power to keep up their medication, to keep a step ahead of their illness, and to get appropriate help based on their needs. This empowered them to stay on track with their illness, thus in control of it. It was also reported that MindFrame could fuel the fear of restraint and illness exacerbation, thereby disempowering some from feeling certain and secure. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that young adults diagnosed with schizophrenia are amenable to use a smartphone app to monitor their health, manage their medication, and stay alert of the early signs of illness exacerbation. This May empower them to stay on track with their illness, thus in control of it. This indicates the potential of smartphone-based care being capable of aiding this specific population to more confidently manage their new life situation.

When MindFrame was used with the HCPs consistently for more than a month, it could provide them with the power to keep up their medication, to keep a step ahead of their illness, and to get appropriate help based on their needs. This empowered them to stay on track with their illness, thus in control of it. It was also reported that MindFrame could fuel the fear of restraint and illness exacerbation, thereby disempowering some from feeling certain and secure.",13,NA,Only experimental group,YES,USABILITY/UX,NO,Denmark
Article,A mobile App for social anxiety disorder: A three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing mobile and PC-based guided self-help interventions,"Objective: Internet-based cognitive- behavioral treatments (ICBT) have shown promise for various mental disorders, including social anxiety disorder (SAD). Most of these treatments have been delivered on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the reach of ICBT into users' everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT for SAD. This three-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL). Method: A total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self-report measures and diagnostic status of SAD. Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d = 0.74; App vs. WL: d = 0.89) and promising diagnostic response rates (NNTPC = 3.33; NNTApp = 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between-groups effects were found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen's d = 0.07). Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Program use was more evenly spread throughout the day in the mobile condition, indicating an integration of the program into daily routines. Conclusions: ICBT can be delivered effectively using smartphones. 2018 American Psychological Association.",Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,T.

Article,Assisting relapse prevention in OCD using a novel mobile appbased intervention: A case report,"Mobile health apps increase the accessibility of cognitive-behavioralâ€“based interventions before, during, or following treatment. GGOC is a mobile app designed to challenge maladaptive beliefs in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This single-case study assesses the usefulness of GGOC as a relapse prevention tool for OCD. The patient was a 26-year-old woman with severe contamination and washing/cleaning OCD symptoms (Y-BOCS = 33). GGOC was used for relapse prevention following CBT treatment. The patient completed 47 levels dedicated to OCD-relevant maladaptive beliefs. Before and after GGOC, the Y-BOCS, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI-R), Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-20), and Depression subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale were completed. The OBQ-20 and OCI-R scores decreased from pre- to post-GGOC. The Y-BOCS decreased from 7 pre-GGOC to 2 post-GGOC. Findings support the efficacy of GGOC as a relapse prevention tool for individuals with OCD, and its contribution to maintaining gains after CBT. (Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic, 82[4], 390â€“406).

Article,"Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Effectiveness of a Peer-Delivered and Technology Supported Self-Management Intervention for Older Adults with Serious Mental Illness","To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a peer-delivered and technology supported integrated medical and psychiatric self-management intervention for older adults with serious mental illness. Ten older adults with serious mental illness (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder) and medical comorbidity (i.e., cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and/or high cholesterol) aged 60 years and older received the PeerTECH intervention in their homes. Three certified peer specialists were trained to deliver PeerTECH. Data were collected at baseline, one-month, and three-month. The pilot study demonstrated that a three-month, peer-delivered and technology-supported integrated medical and psychiatric self-management intervention (â€œPeerTECHï¿½?) was experienced by peer specialists and participants as feasible and acceptable. PeerTECH was associated with statistically significant improvements in psychiatric self-management. In addition, pre/post, non-statistically significant improvements were observed in self-efficacy for managing chronic health conditions, hope, quality of life, medical self-management skills, and empowerment. This pre/post pilot study demonstrated it is possible to train peers to use technology to deliver an integrated psychiatric and medical self-management intervention in a home-based setting to older adults with serious mental illness with fidelity. These findings provide preliminary evidence that a peer-delivered and technology-supported intervention designed to improve medical and psychiatric self-management is feasible, acceptable, and is potentially associated with improvements in psychiatric self-management, self-efficacy for managing chronic health conditions, hope, quality of life, medical self-management skills, and empowerment with older adults with serious mental illness and chronic health conditions. 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Psychiatric Quarterly,S.J.

Article,Using smartphone apps to promote psychiatric rehabilitation in a peer-led community support program: Pilot study,"Background: Management of severe and persistent mental illness is a complex, resource-intensive challenge for individuals, their families, treaters, and the health care system at large. Community-based rehabilitation, in which peer specialists provide support for individuals managing their own condition, has demonstrated effectiveness but has only been implemented in specialty centers. It remains unclear how the peer-based community rehabilitation model could be expanded, given that it requires significant resources to both establish and maintain. Objective: Here, we describe the results from a study of one such program implemented within Waverley Place, a community support program at McLean Hospital, emphasizing psychiatric rehabilitation for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness, as well as describing the challenges encountered during the implementation of the program. Key questions were whether the patients could, and would, successfully use the app. Methods: The smartphone app offered multiple features relevant to psychiatric rehabilitation, including daily task lists, activity tracking, and text messaging with peer specialists. A 90-day program of activities, goals, and content specific to the community support program was created on the basis of a prior pilot, in collaboration between members of the app development team (WellFrame), and peers, clinical, and research staff associated with the program. Hospital research staff recruited patients into the study, monitored peer and patient engagement, and handled all raw data acquired from the study. Results: Of 100 people approached for the study, a total of 13 provided consent, of which 10 downloaded and used the app. Two patients were unable to complete the app installation. Five used the app regularly as part of their daily lives for at least 20 days of the 90-day program. We were unable to identify any specific factors (eg, clinical or demographic) that affected willingness to consent or engage with the app platform in the very limited sample, although the individuals with significant app use were generally satisfied with the experience. Conclusions: Smartphone apps may become a useful tool for psychiatric rehabilitation, addressing both psychiatric and co-occurring medical problems. Individualizing functions to each patient and facilitating connection with a certified peer specialist may be an important feature of useful apps. Unlike prior reports emphasizing that patients with schizophrenia will adopt smartphone platforms, we found that implementation of digital tools into existing community support programs for severe and persistent mental illness has many challenges yet to be fully overcome to realize the potential benefits such apps could have to promote systematization and cost reduction for psychiatric rehabilitation.

Article,A pilot study of user satisfaction and perceived helpfulness of the Swedish version of the mobile app PTSD Coach,"Background: There is a need for accessible interventions in the aftermath of traumatic events with documented efficacy for preventing or reducing negative mental health consequences. The PTSD Coach is a mobile app that has shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTSS). Objective: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the user satisfaction, perceived helpfulness and potential reductions of PTSS and symptoms of depression among participants using the Swedish version of the PTSD Coach. Method: This was an uncontrolled pre-test post-test open trial including participants recruited from the community via advertisement and from an ongoing observational study who had experienced a potentially traumatic event in the last five years. Participants had access to the Swedish PTSD Coach app for four weeks. Results: Eleven participants (mean age = 38.6, female = 8) completed the study. Nine of the participants met criteria for full or partial PTSD. Results from the PTSD Coach Survey indicated that participants found the app slightly to moderately helpful and were slightly to moderately satisfied with the app. Nominal but not statistically significant reductions of medium effect sizes in PTSS (PCL-5) and depression (PHQ-9) from pre- to post-assessment were found. In interviews, participants indicated that they found elements such as learning about PTSD, breathing exercises and monitoring symptoms helpful in managing symptoms. However, several participants indicated that they had not used the app as much as they had intended to. Participants also had suggestions for improvements such as enhanced app structure and better guidance regarding how to use the app. Conclusions: The perceived helpfulness and user satisfaction were slightly lower compared to research on the original version of the app. Experiences from the study are discussed and a future controlled study of the Swedish version of the PTSD Coach is suggested. 2018 The Author(s).
